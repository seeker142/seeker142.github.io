<h2>Regarding the Removal of Disqus</h2>

Hello readers,

As you've probably noticed, Disqus has removed itself from my site. I guess I was mistakenly included in the banwave that affected many manga/anime piracy sites. I've checked the Disqus forums for a way to appeal the ban, but it seems they do not offer support to those with a basic account.

The email they sent me: [https://i.imgur.com/qQ6dRVL.png](https://i.imgur.com/qQ6dRVL.png)

Currently, I have swapped the comment system to use Giscus as a replacement. One problem is that Giscus requires creating a GitHub account to post comments or react. This isn't a big hurdle by any means, but even a minor annoyance will make people think twice about commenting. Especially after years worth of comments were deleted so suddenly.

The biggest reason I started translating was because I wanted to see more people talking about stories I enjoyed, so the loss of Disqus is an unfortunate setback. I know many are uninterested in making an account, and that is perfectly understandable. Hopefully, you can find another medium to express yourselves, such as Reddit or Discord. I will do my best to read all of the comments posted there as well.

- [TenKen Discord](https://discord.com/invite/VQ32Ywm)

Either way, I must apologize to all my readers for this inconvenience. I plan to keep translating for as long as I can, and I hope you will continue reading.
