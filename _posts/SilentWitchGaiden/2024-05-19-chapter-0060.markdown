<h2>[V5C2] Temporary Conclusion of a Romance Novice</h2>

After returning home to Sazandol, Monica changed out of her formal robes and took a book from her bag.

Rather than a book on magecraft or mathematics, it was a romance novel.

——*"Which means you like this 'Cyril-sama' guy, and you got jealous of the young lady who was rumored to be his fiancé."*

Clifford's observation struck Monica surprisingly profoundly. If what he said was true, it made sense why she couldn't celebrate Cyril's engagement.

And indeed, Clifford was likely correct. She was in love with Cyril.

...However, this was akin to a problem in mathematics.

When faced with a challenging math problem, Monica couldn't be satisfied just knowing the answer. Even if she had the correct answer, she hadn't truly understood it until she verified the intermediate steps herself.

The same applied to matters of the heart. Monica wasn't content simply getting the answer from Clifford. She had to scrutinize the process before she could be convinced it was true.

That was why Monica decided to pick up a romance novel. Just as she would read a math book when stuck on a difficult problem, for Monica, picking up a romance novel to understand love was the natural course of action.

Thus, after the unveiling of Lana's robe, Monica visited the library alone and, overcoming her embarrassment, asked the librarian this:

*Please find me an easily understandable book on introductory romance.*

...The librarian's endearing smile was almost unbearable.

Monica received the book selected by the librarian and began reading it in the carriage. Of course, she ended up suffering motion sickness.

Now lying down on her bed, Monica opened the book to her bookmark, reading the romance novel with a stern expression as if facing a complex math problem.

"...Hmm..."

Previously, when Glenn had been studying a magic textbook, he had stated, "I understand what's written, but I don't get the meaning!"

Monica's current state of mind was precisely that.

She understood what was written, but the parts of "why" and "how" remained completely incomprehensible.

(...I wonder if a love expert like Ike would get it right away.)

However, it was far too embarrassing to ask someone else about this particular issue.

(...Falling in love isn't supposed to be shameful, so why does it feel so embarrassing...?)

The moment Clifford pointed out that Monica liked Cyril, her cheeks turned flush with embarrassment, and her head went completely blank. Her heart raced as if she had just undergone a full sprint.

Many say that "love is a sickness".

Monica remembered Claudia saying, "There's no medicine to cure the sickness of love," from her student days. Since she was a member of the Lineage of Knowledge, her words were most likely accurate.

In the novel, when the heroine became aware of her feelings of love, the male lead magically reciprocated her feelings. Despite re-reading and scrutinizing that scene many times, Monica couldn't understand how and when the mutual love occurred.

Ultimately, she finished the novel without understanding a single thing. Monica sighed and closed the book.

(What is it that I really want, anyway...)

Monica was content with the current situation of being able to work with Cyril. Just receiving his occasional praise made her happy, so she wondered what else there was to wish for.

Despite infiltrating Serendia Academy under a false identity, she retained a connection to her important friends even after revealing her true self.

That alone made her happy enough to cry. Asking for more would be too greedy.

(...Moreover, if I keep acting like this... I might not be able to do my job. I would be causing trouble, especially with the collaborative research.)

To Monica, the scariest outcome was her behavior causing Cyril trouble. It was clear that her love would undoubtedly cause trouble for many people.

Once she realized that, she felt a pressure in the depths of her chest.

(...In that case... I should hide my feelings, so Cyril-sama doesn't notice. This is probably the best solution.)

Monica turned over and closed her eyes, leaving the romance novel by her pillow.

<p style="text-align: center;">＊　＊　＊</p>

"Monica, the soup is ready. Do you have an appetite?"

Isaac opened the door after knocking, finding Monica curled up and asleep on the bed. Approaching the bedside quietly, Isaac noticed a book lying there.

It had a different design from the mathematical and magical books Monica usually read. It was a romance novel.

(Did she borrow this from Miss Colette? Or...)

Isaac brushed away the strand of hair that fell over Monica's cheek, gently touching her skin as if handling a precious treasure.

"...This is troublesome."

In the past, he could easily have kissed her on the cheek. Now, he found himself hesitating.

"...You're precious to me."

The Starseer Witch had foretold his fate. Isaac would eventually lose half of his world.

"...I don't want to lose you."

Isaac led a double life as Felix Arc Ridill the Duke of Erin, and Isaac Walker the disciple of the Silent Witch. To him, this house with Monica was half of the world.

If the Starseer Witch's prophecy turned out as Isaac expected... then he would lose Monica.

Just thinking about something happening to Monica sent a chill down Isaac's spine.

——*Please, I beg you, don't take anything more from me.*

Isaac muttered those words in his heart and put on a dark smile. He felt pathetic.

Because he knew. Merely praying wouldn't make anything come true.

Therefore, to protect his happy times with Monica, Isaac decided to take action himself. He must stomp out all the sparks that might threaten to burn himself or Monica.

Isaac covered Monica with a blanket, tiptoed out of the room, and descended to the first floor. He spotted Nero's tail sticking out of a gap in the shelves and called out to him.

"Nero, I'm thinking of grilling some chicken for you tonight."

The sulking Nero, still wedged into the narrow gap, adeptly turned his body to face Isaac with a skeptical look.

"So you're plotting something, huh?"

"Yeah. Will you lend me a hand?"

Isaac crouched in front of the shelf, making eye contact with Nero.

Nero's golden eyes sparkled suspiciously, and he let out a sly hiss from his throat.

"Foolish human. Trying to tame me with mere bird meat. Such arrogance..."

"I'm thinking of grilling a whole chicken, and there will be three types of sauces. Maybe I'll use meat for the side dishes too. I can also add rabbit pie at your request."

"Alright, tell me the details."

"I appreciate the quick response."

And so, Isaac Walker, the disciple of the Silent Witch, successfully managed to win over the Black Dragon of Worgan with meat dishes.

Isaac was prepared to purchase a whole cow or pig, so honestly, the ease of acceptance surprised him. However, Nero remained oblivious to this.
