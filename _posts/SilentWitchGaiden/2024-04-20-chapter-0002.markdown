<h2>[SS2] Discussion on Titles</h2>

Monica had recently been frequently visiting Cyril's residence, the home of Marquis Highown.

Due to their collaborative research with the Thorn Witch Raul Roseberg, Monica and Raul were allowed to use the land of House Highown. Since the research details were top-secret, meeting at the Marquis's residence was the most convenient option.

However, Marquis Highown was a busy man. His son Cyril was given the job of compiling and presenting the reports to the Marquis. Lately, the standard procedure involved the three of them——Cyril, Raul, and Monica——having discussions in one of the rooms of the mansion.

<br/>

On that day, the trio was reviewing the results of their research in the guest room.

Monica had meticulously analyzed and compiled data regarding the trends, but due to the sheer volume, her documents took time to fully consume.

Having finished reviewing the documents, Cyril let out a long sigh and lightly rubbed his eyes. Seeing this, Monica frowned apologetically.

"Um... I'm sorry. My data was too detailed, wasn't it...?"

Monica loved delving into intricate numbers, so her heart would leap with joy at extensive data. However, for material meant to be presented to others, she should have summarized it in a more readable manner.

Cyril shook his head at the remorseful Monica.

"No need to apologize. The detailed data is not a problem since it's so well-organized. I'll handle the selection of information to report to Father, so you don't need to change a thing."

Monica breathed a sigh of relief at Cyril's words. Meanwhile, Raul, who had been casually skimming through the documents, stretched his arms while expressing admiration.

"Cyril, Monica, you two are amazing. I've always been awful at this kind of thing... I'd rather feel the growth of plants with my own eyes than look at numbers..."

"Lord Roseberg, you are the one in charge of making the fertilizer. We cannot have you behaving that way."

"Come on, why so serious? We're farming buddies, right? Just call me Raul."

Cyril casually ignored Raul and pointed out a few areas for improvement.

Monica recorded Cyril's suggestions and proposed additional improvements. Cyril then scheduled the tasks, and Monica fine-tuned the details.

Since Cyril and Monica had worked together as student council members during their time at Serendia Academy, they were accustomed to this type of collaboration and could understand each other's intentions down to the fine details.

Thinking back, even during their student council days, Monica would prepare records for Cyril to compile, then he would report them to the student council president and teachers.

(It feels so nostalgic...)

Monica never imagined she would be working with Cyril like this after leaving Serendia Academy.

Reflecting on this small joy, Monica continued working on the documents.

Once their work reached a good stopping point, Raul interjected with a hearty laugh.

"Man, I'm awful with details, so I'm really grateful you two are here. Cyril, Monica, you guys are just so reliable."

Monica secretly smiled at Raul's words. Being acknowledged as "reliable" by someone made her genuinely happy.

With a bashful smile, Monica handed Raul a sheet summarizing the details of fertilizer.

"This is for you, Thorn Witch-sama. Please take it."

"Thanks! But if possible, could you call me by my name instead of my title?"

"Um, I'm sorry... I'm not really used to that kind of thing..."

As Monica fidgeted with her fingers, Raul blinked his verdant green eyes and tilted his head.

"But Monica, you always call him 'Louis-san', not 'Barrier Mage-sama', right?"

Monica was momentarily taken aback by Raul's remark. Although she hadn't been conscious of it, Raul was right.

Seeming slightly interested in the exchange between Raul and Monica, Cyril interjected with a somewhat surprised expression.

"Isn't it customary for the Seven Sages to be addressed by their titles?"

"Nah, there's no set rule, really. It's just that Monica always refers to us by our titles, so I was wondering why she calls Louis-san by his name."

Monica lowered her round eyes as she contemplated. In truth, it was a subconscious habit of hers.

(Why is that... um...)

Was it because Louis joined the Seven Sages at the same time as her? No, not quite. While nodding thoughtfully, Monica traced her memories and suddenly clapped her hands.

"Well, you see... I've known Louis-san by his name since my time at Minerva."

Having learned chantless magic and skipped grades, Monica became affiliated with the research lab of Professor Gideon Rutherford, one of Minerva's top teachers.

However, Monica hadn't learned much from Professor Rutherford, to be honest. She just spent her time freely researching under the title of Rutherford's research assistant.

So while Monica respected Rutherford as her former teacher, she didn't consider him her master.

When Rutherford used to tell stories from the past, he often mentioned "the foolish disciple Louis."

During her time at Minerva, Monica heard many times about the commotion Louis caused while he was a student, directly from Professor Rutherford.

Therefore, Monica had recognized Louis as "Louis-san, the disciple often mentioned by Professor Rutherford" from all the way back then.

"So that's why I've been unconsciously calling him 'Louis-san' for some reason."

"Hmm, I see. Then why do you call Cyril 'Cyril-sama'?"

"Well, that's..."

As Monica pondered how to explain, Cyril narrowed his blue eyes and looked at Raul and Monica.

"Let's cut the chit chat. Monica, bring those documents over there."

"..."

"Monica?"

"...! Ah! Yes, right away!"

Monica fumbled around with her hands and presented a completely irrelevant document to Cyril, who gave her a doubtful glance.

<br/>

Every time Cyril called her by name, a strange feeling stirred in the depths of Monica's chest. It was a secret sensation that only Monica knew.
