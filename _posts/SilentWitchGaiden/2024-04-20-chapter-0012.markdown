<h2>[V1C6] Girl Meets Dragon</h2>

The young company president Lana Colette had been troubled recently.

Her company primarily dealt with magical tool materials, but lately, they had also ventured into designing magical tools, as well as robes for mages.

Lana had a particular interest in clothing, so she emphasized the design of robes and cloaks.

Currently, most mage robes in circulation had either an antiquated design, appearing terribly plain, or were overly flashy, presumably to signify authority. It seemed that mages, including her friend Monica, tended to lean toward extremes.

Lana wanted to introduce new robes into the industry, ones that were not only fashionable but also comfortable and easy to move in.

...With this intention in mind, she proposed various design ideas, created prototypes, and began marketing them.

However, the response from older, authoritative individuals was lacking, even if the younger generation generally responded well.

Despite the advantages of functionality and relatively affordable prices, the older mages found solace in the familiarity of old brands and were reluctant to change.

In other words, Lana thought it was their reluctance to embrace new things. However, she understood that not everyone in the world shared her perspective.

An event for unveiling new robes was scheduled for the beginning of the year, with many renowned mages and the faculty of Minerva invited. It was the perfect chance for Lana to make her debut.

However, Lana had not yet decided on the centerpiece robe for the event.

(This time, the highlight is a men's robe... The fabric and silhouette are mostly decided, but I need something to capture the stubborn minds of the elderly.)

She tried sketching various design ideas on the paper in front of her, but none of them stood out.

Lana threw down her quill, wrapped the stole hanging on the back of the chair around herself, and stood up.

At times like this, she would always take a stroll. Walking through the market and looking at various items might spark new ideas.

(Might as well drop by Monica's place. "He" has been away these past few days, I think.)

Lana had various opinions regarding Monica and her disciple, but she highly appreciated the dramatic improvement he gave to Monica's diet.

When that disciple was away, Monica's meals inevitably became lackluster. Without him there, she would likely get too absorbed in research to have a proper meal.

Lana decided to buy some food from the market stalls and have lunch together at Monica's house. It would be two birds with one stone.

"Cliff, I'm going out for a bit. Take care of the shop."

Lana called out to her secretary, not waiting for a response, and hastily left the company building.

<p style="text-align: center;">＊　＊　＊</p>

Having bought bread, apples, and fried fish dumplings at the market, Lana headed towards Monica's house, observing the clothes of passersby.

Sazandol, being a thriving port town for trade, had various people coming and going. Some wore clothes not seen in this country, so it was impossible to get bored.

(But none of them really match the design of the new robes... Oh right. I also need to find someone to model on the day of the event...)

For the highlight, she wanted a male model with a dignified and mysterious atmosphere.

Several candidates had already been suggested through her business connections, but finding someone who perfectly fit the image was proving challenging.

(While Glenn is tall and has a commanding presence, his image doesn't quite match the concept for the robe this time... I want someone dignified, tall, in their mid-twenties, preferably with black hair.)

Lost in her thoughts, Lana eventually arrived at Monica's house.

Switching her focus, Lana knocked on the door. There was no answer... but when it came to Monica, the lack of response usually meant she had succumbed to hunger and collapsed on the floor. Such things happened occasionally.

As Lana debated whether to open the door, it swung open. However, the one who opened it was not Monica, nor was it her disciple.

A stranger with unfamiliar black hair stood before her. He appeared to be in his mid-twenties, tall, with sharp eyes. Judging by his old-fashioned robe not commonly seen in this area, he was probably a mage friend of Monica's.

As Lana attempted to greet him, the man bent down, peering directly into Lana's face. Despite Lana's displeasure at his impoliteness, the man smiled proudly.

"I remember your name. Lana, right? Monica used to mention you a lot when she was in school."

Although surprised at the sudden mention of her name, Lana figured that if the usually shy Monica had talked about her to this man, they must be close to each other.

"Is Monica here?"

"Nah, she's not home right now. She went to the Chilly Guy's place for a meeting."

The "Chilly Guy" probably referred to Cyril Ashley.

Lana had heard a few times about Monica collaborating with the Thorn Witch under the sponsorship of Marquis Highown. However, she hadn't expected Monica to be out at a time like this.

(...Aw, I wanted to have lunch together.)

Disappointed and slumping her shoulders, Lana noticed that the black-haired man was staring intently at the basket in her hands. His golden eyes sparkled like a cat eyeing a fish.

Lana gently extended the basket.

"...I was planning to eat this with Monica, but would you like to have it instead?"

"Seriously!? I'll take it!"

Without hesitation, the man accepted the basket, chuckled happily, and licked his lips.

His behavior ended up being a bit disappointing, but he seemed like a visually striking man when silent. He had a good physique and slender limbs. His mysterious golden eyes had the power to captivate onlookers.

(...But why is he wearing such an old-fashioned robe?)

The robe the man wore resembled costumes used in plays, so old in design that it could pass for a theatrical wardrobe. It was similar to the costumes used at Serendia Academy's cultural festival.

"Why are you wearing such an old robe?"

Unable to resist her curiosity, Lana asked, fully aware of the impoliteness. Without showing any signs of offense, the man nibbled on the basket's bread while replying.

"Mm, a long time ago, the clothes worn by someone I met looked like this. So, I imitated them."

"...?"

Though his wording was peculiar, it seemed that the clothing was worn by someone crucial in his life, and held significant meaning for him. That person was likely an actor in a classical play.

Upon closer inspection, the intricate vine pattern on the robe's hem was remarkably detailed.

(...Come to think of it, mages find meaning even in these subtle patterns.)

Suddenly, a new robe design popped into Lana's head.

Could the patterns on this man's robe, with their classical significance, be applied to the robe she was making?

(A modern and classical fusion...! How could I forget what I learned at Serendia Academy's cultural festival!)

While Lana tended to chase after trendy patterns and colors, there was much to be learned from the old. Above all, things that cherished the traditions were more easily accepted by the elderly.

(Instead of using the pattern as it is, if I use it a bit smaller on the hem... yes, it would make a nice accent. And if the gold thread has a slightly subdued color rather than sparkling, it would blend in nicely...)

The design concept for the new robe was becoming more and more concrete in Lana's mind.

(Most importantly, this man... he perfectly matches the image of the new design!)

A new design concept and a suitable model. Lana felt uplifted, having solved everything she was worried about.

Ideally, she would want to negotiate with this man for the modeling job right away, but they had only just met. Since he was an acquaintance of Monica, it would be more appropriate to get an introduction from her.

Lana clenched her fist tightly, leaned forward, and looked up at the man.

"Sir, may I ask for your name?"

"Sure, it's Bartholomew Alexander."

A grand name, more specifically the name of a protagonist in an adventure novel.

(I see, he must be an actor.)

If that were the case, Lana could understand the choice of this old-fashioned costume. After convincing herself, Lana put on a polite smile.

"Alexander-san, would you be interested in dining together sometime with Monica?"

"Will there be meat? I like chicken."

"Sure, I will prepare that for you... Well then, excuse my sudden visit. Good day."

Lana curtsied gracefully, flipped the hem of her skirt, and hurriedly headed back to her company.

She wanted to get home quickly and sketch out the ideas for the robe.

(...Come to think of it, what kind of relationship does Alexander-san have with Monica? He seemed to know her since our time at Serendia Academy.)

Lana decided she would ask the next time she met Monica.

Putting away such doubts, Lana immersed herself in the design concepts for the new robe.
