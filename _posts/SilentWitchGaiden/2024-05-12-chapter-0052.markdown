<h2>[V4C10] The Silent Witch Wants to Be Relied On</h2>

The group relocated to the reception room of Lana's Flux Company.

Since the company's employees had long since clocked out for the day, Lana took it upon herself to prepare tea for everyone.

Generally, this would be Clifford's duty as her secretary, but he was the type of person who claimed that "all teas taste like leaves". Clearly, he couldn't be entrusted with black tea.

"It must be tough with so many people. Allow me to assist you."

Isaac Walker offered to help Lana prepare tea in the kitchen.

In response, Lana awkwardly smiled and shook her head.

"It's fine, please make yourself comfortable."

Isaac behaved in a friendly manner towards Lana, but she was secretly troubled about how to act around him.

After all, his public face was that of the Second Prince of this country, Felix Arc Ridill.

If she called Monica's secret disciple "Your Highness", his true identity would be revealed. Neither Isaac nor Monica wanted that.

Therefore, Lana treated Isaac with an attitude akin to a friend's brother.

(...Well, he probably doesn't want to be thought of as a "brother".)

The relationship between Isaac and Monica was extremely complex. However, it was certain that Isaac had feelings for Monica.

Regarding such matters, Lana tried not to interfere too much. Of course, if Monica sought advice, Lana would be willing to help.

After closing the lid of the teapot filled with hot water, Lana turned back to Isaac and bowed.

"Um, Cliff... my secretary Clifford Anderson was terribly rude. As the company president, I apologize on his behalf."

"Anderson? ...Could it be that he is from the Anderson Company?"

"Yes, um, he's the son of the Chairman Anderson... I'm surprised you know about them."

Honestly, Lana didn't think that the Second Prince would remember the name of individual companies.

Seeing Lana unable to hide her surprise, Isaac let out a soft chuckle.

"The Anderson Company is quite famous actually."

The Anderson Company, Clifford's family, had built a fortune with a business that applied ice magic to food preservation technology.

Especially when it came to transporting fresh food, the Anderson Company was unparalleled, considered at the pinnacle of the transportation industry.

However, this business utilizing ice magic had become a source of controversy among the domestic nobility.

Magic was once a technology kept secret, monopolized by the royalty and nobility.

Though the gates had opened to the common people about a hundred years ago, the perception that "magic is a technology for the privileged" still lingered in many circles.

Therefore, the Anderson Company, which conducted broad business with this special technology, was detested by the conservative upper-class nobles.

What's more, this faction of conservative nobles included Duke Crockford and many supporters of the Second Prince.

"The Anderson Company didn't get along well with the conservative Duke Crockford. There were even some within the Second Prince faction who proposed boycotting the Anderson Company."

So what happened to the Anderson Company when they were shunned by the Second Prince faction?

The answer lies in the fact that fresh meat and fish are delivered to Serendia Academy under the auspices of Duke Crockford.

People cannot resist delicious or convenient things. The Anderson Company, with the power of its "convenience," even managed to win the approval of the conservative nobles, including Duke Crockford.

The one who pulled this off was Clifford's father, the chairman of the Anderson Company.

"I heard Chairman Anderson is a man who loves new things. Moreover, I hear his wife is from the desert peoples."

"...Yes, Clifford's mother is from Shezaria."

People from Shezaria were colloquially referred to as "the desert peoples". With hair blacker than the night sky, dark-colored skin, and distinct facial features, their appearance was unmistakable.

"So that's why he dresses like that."

"..."

Lana found herself at a loss for words. Taking the time to explain Clifford's personality or circumstances would surely let the tea go cold.

As Lana fell silent, Isaac lifted the teapot and poured it evenly into the cups. His movements were smooth and experienced.

"I'll be waiting here. I don't think there's anyone here who recognizes the Second Prince's face, but just in case."

"In that case, I'll prepare a separate guest room for you."

She couldn't simply have the Second Prince waiting in the kitchen. However, Isaac shook his head and gave a slight shrug.

"I'm just Isaac Walker right now. It might raise suspicions if I were given a splendid room, don't you think?"

"But..."

"I'm here by choice, so don't worry about it. Call me if you run into trouble. I'll come right away."

His smile looked exactly the same as the one he made in Serendia Academy, making him seem oddly friendly.

In the reception room, Porok, the embroidery craftsman, and the brothers Anthony and Teodor were getting along well, discussing their favorite drinks. Porok had apparently taken a liking to the brothers.

Monica sat uncomfortably in the corner of the sofa, while Clifford, despite being a secretary, adopted a somewhat arrogant posture in his chair.

Holding back the impulse to smack the back of his head, Lana distributed tea to everyone.

"There are many things I'd like to say... but first, Porok-san, can you accept the embroidery design? If we don't start soon, it won't be ready in time."

"Hmm? Well, show me what you got."

Lana held back her frustration at Porok's arrogant reply, handing the design to him.

Porok roughly grabbed the design and, in the next moment, dropped it to the floor.

"No good. Do it over."

Lana desperately suppressed the urge to shout. After taking a deep breath, she questioned him in a low tone.

"...Could you please tell me the reason?"

"I've already said this many times. You lack knowledge."

Without any sign of elaborating, Porok began picking at his ear. His attitude conveyed that Lana was not worth his time.

"Please, tell me more specifically. The calculations for the mana to be applied to the embroidery should be correct. This pattern is based on historical designs and..."

"Ugh, this is hopeless. You're no good at all."

"That's why I'm asking! Please, tell me what's wrong. I'm begging you!"

"*Sigh*, these young ones nowadays, always demanding answers without bothering to do the research on their own. That kind of attitude is what makes the magical tool industry seem cheap. Do you understand, ignorant young lady?"

Lana bit her lip and fell silent.

An ignorant young lady. That was the general perception of Lana held by most people.

The establishment of her trading company was only possible because of her father's financial support, including resources and connections.

She hadn't achieved anything on her own.

It didn't matter how much effort she put into studying economics or the creation of magical tools.

(Why... why...?)

Holding back tears, Lana clenched her fists and trembled. Meanwhile, Porok sneered arrogantly at her.

"That's how you've always gotten what you wanted, right? Crying to daddy. And you call yourself a company president..."

"...That way of speaking is, um, mean."

Monica interjected from her spot at the corner of the sofa.

This caused Porok to glare back with squinted eyes.

"Missy, amateurs shouldn't interfere with a craftsman's talk."

"...The robe's design originates from the Lethe Faction, and the magical formula embroidered into the robe is from the Kujura Tribe. Since Kujura's mages were annihilated by the Lethe Faction, it makes no sense to apply Kujura embroidery to a Lethe robe... Is that what you are trying to say?"

After explaining in an unwavering tone, Monica stared at Porok expressionlessly.

Her current face was different from the usual helpless Monica——this was her speaking as the Silent Witch, one the country's foremost mages.

Lana, Anthony, and Teodor all gave Monica expressions of astonishment. Clifford was the only one whose expression didn't change much.

In the midst of this, Porok stroked his braided beard and grinned.

"Hoh? Looks like you brought someone who actually knows her stuff. Little missy, if you've delved into magic even a little, you should understand the history of Kujura's persecution. The theme of this robe is the fusion of old and new. But I won't sew embroidery that disrespects history, not even a single stitch."

"...So it would be fine as long as there are no historical issues, right?"

Though Monica's voice was stiff, Porok nodded at her question. Then, Monica turned to Lana.

"Lana, is the shape of the robe already fixed?"

"Y-Yes."

"Okay, I'll draw all the patterns that can be used on this robe. Choose the one that matches your image from there."

Lana went speechless when she heard that.

Monica said it so casually, but this was by no means an easy task. Patterns incorporating magical formulas were incredibly complex.

Since Lana had fallen silent, Teodor, who had been listening to the conversation, asked his brother.

"Hey, brother. How many of those are there?"

"Hmm... Not sure since I can only handle magic swords... but there should be a vast number of them. Perhaps a hundred or so?"

"No."

Monica shook her head, still looking at the design.

"About 1,300."

Hearing her casual tone, Anthony's eyes widened, and Teodor blinked a few times.

Clifford, who had been silent until now, turned his expressionless gaze to Monica and finally opened his mouth.

"That's impossible. No one can do that."

"I can. Just drawing remembered patterns like this... It's not difficult at all for me, so..."

Cutting off her words there, the expressionless Monica suddenly looked embarrassed. She lowered her head and fiddled with her fingers.

While quivering her lips, she continued in a quiet voice.

"S-so, um... that's why, if Lana relies on me... I-I'd be very happy."

Those words shook Lana's heart.

Enough already, enough already! Lana repeated in her mind and roughly wiped away the tears that welled up at the corners of her eyes with the back of her hand.

"I'm really picky about designs, you know? You might have to draw until morning."

"That's okay. I'm good at all-nighters."

Monica lowered her eyebrows, exhaled with a slight "hmph," and smiled. Upon seeing that typical Monica smile, the smile naturally returned to Lana's face too.

With the proudest expression she could manage, Lana said, "Hey, Cliff! Look how reliable my friend is!"
