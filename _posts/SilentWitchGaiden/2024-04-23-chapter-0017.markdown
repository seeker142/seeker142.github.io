<h2>[V2C3] Shake Hands with Me in the Village of the Silent Witch!</h2>

"Eehehehe! I'm the Silent Witch! Now, if you want stamps, eat our village's famous Silent Witch cookies! If you like them, buy plenty and share them with your friends and family."

Saying this, the elderly woman claiming to be the third Silent Witch distributed cookies to Monica and her companions.

The cookies had a crisp and crumbly texture. Simple, but delicious.

While nibbling on the cookies she received, the real Silent Witch was bewildered.

Three stamps had already been pressed on Monica's stamp card. At this rate, she should be able to collect six stamps and receive the commemorative prize.

(Um... Why did I come here again...?)

Unlike Monica, who was slightly forgetting her purpose, Isabelle and the others showed no signs of wavering.

After elegantly finishing the cookies, Isabelle spoke to the elderly woman calling herself the third Silent Witch.

"These cookies are delicious. I'll take some as souvenirs."

"Eehehe, thank you for your patronage."

"By the way, why is this village called the Village of the Silent Witch? It's not like it's her hometown, is it?"

Isabelle casually inquired about what had been bothering Monica.

As Isabelle pointed out, Monica's hometown wasn't Sechen Village. In fact, Monica had never visited this village even once. So, why were the Silent Witches being used as some sort of tourist attraction?

It might make sense the village was in Kerbeck or Reinberg, where she had visited for dragon subjugation, but this village was a completely unrelated place.

While Monica was secretly questioning this, the elderly woman selling sweets grinned.

"I can't say it loudly, but the real Silent Witch-sama has visited this village before."

That was news to Monica.

Isaac, who was nibbling on a cookie next to Monica, pretended to wipe a crumb off her face and whispered.

(...Is that so?)

(I-It's news to me!)

Despite being "unable to say it loudly", the elderly woman continued in a volume so that everyone around could hear.

"Two years ago, the Silent Witch subjugated the curse dragon in Reinberg, and stopped by Sechen Village along with Second Prince Felix, who fought alongside her. The two of them took a break in this village to heal their wounds from the encounter."

Isaac murmured with a wry smile at the woman's words, "I see, news to me too."

Naturally, neither Monica nor Isaac had undergone recuperation here.

However, Sechen Village was located between Reinberg and the royal capital. In other words, the second prince's entourage stopping by on their way back to the capital after subjugating the curse dragon was a believable story.

...Of course, all of it was complete fiction.

"Our hot springs are not only effective for all ailments but also known to be good for beauty. Young ladies, take your time and relax."

After saying this, the elderly woman handed Monica another cookie.

<p style="text-align: center;">＊　＊　＊</p>

"...Of all things, why did they have to pick me, the most inconspicuous of the Seven Sages? ...Oh, I think I might understand the reason somehow."

Walking toward the inn, as Monica murmured under her breath, Isabelle exclaimed, "Oh my!" and clung to Monica's arm.

"Onee-sama, you are not at all inconspicuous! You're the savior of our country!"

Agatha also nodded vigorously in agreement.

"That's right. Silent Witch-sama, you defeated the Black Dragon of Worgan and the Curse Dragon of Reinberg, making you a hero on par with the second prince. You're so incredibly famous that everyone in the country knows you."

The term "incredibly famous" made Monica's stomach sting. Especially considering the circumstances of the Black Dragon and Curse Dragon incidents.

A quick glance at Isaac revealed he was remaining completely calm, despite knowing the truth behind the incidents.

"In other words, they're trying to attract tourists by using the Silent Witch's name. Since the Silent Witch's identity is not well-known, it's easy to handle as a topic for this kind of village revitalization."

"I-Is that... so?"

"I debated on whether or not I should tell you this, but..."

"...?"

As Monica tilted her head at Isaac's evasive words, he lightly swept up his bangs with a bitter smile.

"Even though your exposure has increased recently due your academic activities, there are still many people who don't know your face, right? So, various rumors are circulating. Things like the Silent Witch is actually a man, or an old woman with a hunched back..."

Isaac also murmured, "Even though the real one is this cute," but that didn't register within the stunned Monica's ears.

Never did she expect that there were so many rumors circulating about her!

As Monica was shocked by this unexpected truth, a young man walking directly towards them accidentally bumped into Monica's arm as they passed each other.

To say they bumped into each other was an exaggeration——it was more like a light tap. However, the young man stopped and glared at them.

"Ow ow ow ow, that hurt, missy. Ah, it hurts, it hurts, my bone's broken. What are you gonna do about it? Huh? Huh?"

The overly dramatic lines made Isaac, Isabelle, and Agatha squint in disbelief.

However, the timid Monica quickly lowered her head in apology.

"I-I'm so s-sorry."

"Oh, but apologizing won't solve the problem, will it? ...Oh wow, looking closely, that big sister of yours is quite cute."

Saying this, the man's gaze landed on Isabelle.

Monica turned pale. Because she was walking absentmindedly, she had troubled Isabelle!

She had to do something. Monica desperately summoned her courage, shaking and trembling.

"P-Please stop. I-Isabelle-sama hasn't done anything wrong."

Isaac, Isabelle, and Agatha glared at the man with cold eyes from behind Monica's tearful plea, but Monica remained oblivious to this.

Monica desperately considered how she would defuse the situation.

If apologizing didn't work, and if the man resorted to violence, she had to protect Isabelle.

(S-Should I cast a chantless defense barrier? Stir up the wind?)

As Monica brainstormed the most peaceful way to resolve the situation, a young man's voice sounded from behind.

"Hold it right there!"

Turning around, they saw a man in his twenties wearing a blue robe and holding a staff.

He had a slightly curved nose, but his features were distinct and handsome. Perhaps aware of this, he carried himself with a somewhat theatrical and exaggerated demeanor.

The man put on a cool expression and raised his staff.

"As the Silent Witch, I love peace and justice! Villainy will not be tolerated in my village!"

As the real Silent Witch remained literally silent, the ruffian who had been bothering Monica and the others showed exaggerated surprise.

"W-Whaaaaat!? The Silent Witch, you say!?"

"Indeed! I am the Silent Witch!"

The fourth Silent Witch performed a quick spin and revealed his white teeth with a refreshing smile.

"Miss, you may leave everything to me. Take this! Chantless magic! Hyaaa!"

The advantage of chantless magic was that it could be activated quickly without the opponent realizing it.

So why did both the blacksmith at the entrance and this man declare they were using chantless magic?

As the fourth Silent Witch waved his staff haphazardly, a strong wind blew past him. The ruffian bothering Monica and the others screamed and fell on his back.

"Waah, I-I've been beaten!"

Dropping a theatrical throwaway line, the ruffian quickly fled the scene.

Maintaining a friendly smile, Isaac muttered to himself, "What a farce."

"An event involving tourists isn't half bad. Posing as Onee-sama is unforgivable, though."

"True. It's a decent form of village revitalization, if not for posing as the Silent Witch."

At this point, Monica finally realized. The thug was also part of the act. It seemed she was the only one who hadn't noticed.

As she bowed her head in embarrassment, the fourth Silent Witch offered a handkerchief to Monica.

"Hey, are you injured, miss? Come on, wipe away those tears. Let's shake hands as a memento."

"T-Thank you very much..."

As Monica was about to shake hands, Isaac grabbed her shoulder and pulled her back.

Then, with a cold smile, Isaac waved his stamp card in front of the fourth Silent Witch's nose.

"How about a commemorative stamp?"

"Oh, of course! You've already collected three. Then this will be your fourth. Do your best to collect the remaining two!"

After pressing stamps onto everyone's cards, the fourth Silent Witch said, "If you want a drink, come to Kirk's Tavern! It's just around the corner," and left. Quite a business-savvy Silent Witch.

Watching the fourth Silent Witch's back as he departed, Monica mumbled to herself.

"When he confidently named himself like that... it somehow made him seem like the real deal."

"Onee-sama, get a hold of yourself!"

Isabelle shook Monica's shoulder, as Isaac gripped Monica's hand.

"You're the only witch I admire, my Master."

With Isabelle's lovely face and Isaac's beautiful face leaning in closely, Monica nodded with a vacant smile.
