<h2>[V7C2] An Irritated Guest With a Cheerful Name</h2>

Ten days had passed since Monica returned from Jausuka to Sazandol, and her hand was healing well. Around that time, Isaac and Nero also came back with a pile of souvenirs.

"Oh man, Sparkles's mansion was amazing. The bed was soft, the bath was huge, and the food was delicious."

Nero, now in the form of a young man, happily placed the clattering bags of bottles on the table. Monica gave him a questioning look, and Isaac, who was unpacking another bag, explained with a wry smile.

"You see, my domain of Erin has easy access to high-quality wine from the Kingdom of Falfolia. I've also brought you some foreign dried nuts and fruits..."

Despite Isaac's usual manner of speaking, Monica couldn't shake the feeling that his face seemed more shadowed than usual.

Was it because of his fatigue from recent trip?

Monica had initially planned to inform Isaac and Nero of the dragon commotion at Mount Kalug, involving Cyril and the Roseberg siblings. However, Isaac's current state took higher priority.

"Ike, Ike, um..."

"Yeah?"

Hearing his name called, Isaac paused the souvenir sorting and turned over to Monica. His face had a calm and gentle smile.

However, this wasn't the usual "Ike" smile; it was the smile of "His Highness."

Noticing this, Monica grew uneasy.

(Is Ike hiding something?)

If Isaac was burdened by something and suffering alone, she wanted to help him.

To her, Isaac was her important disciple and friend.

Do you have something on your mind? Can I help? Just as Monica was about to say something along those lines, Nero, who had been arranging the bottles, suddenly interrupted.

"Oi, Monica, this is bad! He's coming! And fast!"

"...He? Who?"

Monica turned to Nero, who had a visible tense face.

"Luntatta! Lunlun Luntatta is right outside!"

Immediately, Monica turned pale. Isaac tilted his head at this reaction, looking puzzled.

"That sounds like a cheerfully-named guest."

"N-No, um, it's Luntatta-san... n-no, I mean Louis-san, the Barrier Mage! Ike, hide! Nero, you too, quickly!"

The Second Prince and the Black Dragon of Worgan were staying at her house. These secrets needed to be kept hidden at all costs.

Moreover, they were dealing with the incredibly perceptive Louis. Monica stood little chance at deceiving him.

Pushed by Monica, Isaac and Nero retreated into the kitchen. Almost immediately afterward, a knock came from the front door.

Monica trembled nervously as she gently opened the door.

Standing in front of the door was, as Nero had said, a man with braided chestnut hair——the Barrier Mage, Louis Miller.

For long-distance travels, he was often accompanied by his contracted spirit Ryn, but today he seemed to be alone.

Rather than the robe of the Seven Sages, he wore rather ordinary outdoor attire.

Louis practically always had a confident and relaxed smile, at least as far as Monica knew. But today, for whatever reason, he seemed a little discontent.

"Greetings, my fellow sage."

"H-Hello... Um, so, what brings you here today...?"

Monica ushered Louis into the room, who promptly noticed the rows of wine bottles and raised an eyebrow.

"Where did you get these wines?"

"Uweh!? Oh, these are, um... souvenirs. Yes, souvenirs. I received a lot from a friend... yes..."

"Hmm, and you would drink this all by yourself?"

"Y-Yes, but I got a lot... um, if you'd like, you can have one..."

As Monica grabbed a bottle, a clattering sound came from the kitchen. Nero had attempted to shout, "My wine!" but Isaac covered his mouth and stopped him.

"Was there a sound from the kitchen just now?"

"I-It's a cat. Yes, just a cat! My familiar!"

With her body now drenched in cold sweat, Monica handed a bottle to Louis.

Louis furrowed his brows slightly, glancing between the door to the kitchen and Monica. Eventually, he accepted the bottle.

"I am very grateful for the gift. Oh, if it isn't Falfolia wine. Quite a good choice."

Meanwhile, noises continued sounding in the kitchen at irregular intervals. Monica could practically hear Nero shouting, "My wine!" any moment now.

She needed to ask for Louis's business, then gently ask him to leave as soon as possible.

Trying her best to avoid eye contact, Monica awkwardly began the conversation.

"S-So, um, what brings you here today...?"

His presence meant this was undoubtedly related to her job as a Sage.

As Monica recalled how this man had sent her to defeat a black dragon and guard the Second Prince, Louis turned to her with his ashen-purple eyes.

"My fellow sage... do you have any acquaintance with the Black Lion Emperor?"

"...Huh?"

At the completely unexpected question, Monica's brain froze for a few seconds.

Monica thought back to the Emperor of the Schwargald Empire. The images that flashed into her mind were of him falling from a tree, paralyzed and supported by his subordinates, and the eccentric remark, "*If you suspect hidden weapons, I can always strip naked. I am confident in my body, after all.*"

Why would Louis mention the Emperor who was confident in his naked body?

In any case, that incident was not something Monica could share with Louis. The Silent Witch and the Black Lion Emperor had no official acquaintance.

"Um, no acquaintance."

"...Then why did the Black Lion Emperor specifically designate you?"

"Designate?"

Monica began having an extremely unpleasant premonition. And her premonitions often turned out to be true.

After resting his chin on his fingers, Louis explained in a low tone that exuded displeasure.

"Very soon, Princess Cecilia, the younger sister of the Black Lion Emperor, will be visiting our country on official business."

"Um, I see."

"For her escort, the Black Lion Emperor has designated you——the Silent Witch."

She had been designated by the Black Lion Emperor as the escort for a princess. Monica was perplexed, unable to grasp the intention behind it.

"M-Me? Escorting a princess? Um, well... Louis-san, aren't you clearly more suitable...?"

At that moment, an ominous cracking sound emanated from Louis's knuckles.

Louis's aura had surpassed the displeasure level, evolving into something unsettling and ominous. Honestly, he was extremely frightening.

By the time Louis had finished cracking his knuckles, Monica was trembling with teary eyes.

When Louis raised his face, he had an unnaturally bright and cheerful smile plastered on.

"You see, I have recently obtained a considerable amount of vacation time."

"...A v-vacation?"

"Yes, along with words of commendation directly from Prince Lionel. Since I have been granted this wonderful opportunity, I want to spend it with my family."

The smile seemed to say that he was overjoyed to receive this vacation. Yet, for some reason, dissatisfaction seeped from his entire being.

As Monica was at a loss for words, Louis continued speaking with the same plastered smile.

"Given that, my fellow sage, I would like you to head to the capital as soon as tomorrow. You will likely need the time for various preparations."

"Um, but... I'm escorting a princess from the Empire, right? I don't know anything about the Empire's etiquette..."

"No need to worry. A young lady well-versed in the Empire has offered to assist you with that part."

"A young lady well-versed in the Empire?"

Monica tilted her head, unable to imagine who that might be. Louis continued, revealing the name.

"Miss Frieda, who is currently staying at the residence of the Abyss Shaman, Ray Albright."

Frieda Blanquet, the fiancé of Ray Albright, was the younger sister of a margrave from the Empire.

Indeed, she would likely be knowledgeable about the Empire's circumstances and etiquette.

"So I ask you to pack up and make your way to the capital with utmost haste. Unfortunately, I won't be able to assist you this time... as I will be on vacation."

Louis emphasized the last few words, still oozing dissatisfaction.

Monica responded while nervously playing with her fingers.

"But, Louis-san, you're friends with Prince Lionel so, erm, wouldn't you be more suitable for the mission...?"

Monica knew that Louis was a classmate and friend of the First Prince.

It might sound strange to bring friendship into politics, but Louis was the prime candidate for the mission, being a member of the Seven Sages as well as a leading member of the First Prince Faction. It didn't make much sense to exclude him from escort duty.

As Monica pointed this out in a mumbled tone, Louis sighed and shrugged his shoulders.

"It appears you have some kind of misunderstanding."

"...Misunderstanding?"

"Prince Lionel and I merely happened to be studying at Minerva at the same time. It would be presumptuous for me to consider him a friend."

Louis continued with a smile backed by immense pressure.

"We are not friends, so your concerns are groundless."

It was then that Monica finally realized the reason for Louis's discontent: He was sulking because his friend didn't ask him for help at a critical moment.

<p style="text-align: center;">＊　＊　＊</p>

Isaac, who had been eavesdropping behind the kitchen door, lowered his head with darkened eyes and clenched at his chest.

(The Black Lion Emperor designating Monica...?)

He knew about the discussions for an engagement between the Emperor's younger sister and the First Prince, but Monica being the escort was completely unexpected.

If Yuan spoke the truth, then Monica had met the Black Lion Emperor. Their meeting was likely related to why he selected Monica as the escort.

In other words, this was happening because of Isaac.

(...I've burdened her.)

Monica had taken on yet another burden without Isaac's knowledge. Every time he witnessed this truth, the guilt tormented him.

Isaac drooped his head. Meanwhile, Nero, who was clamoring for alcohol until a moment ago, crossed his arms and started nodding for some reason.

"I've read about this situation in a book somewhere..."

After a few grunts and groans, Nero recalled what he wanted to say. Brushing back his black hair, he uttered the words with pride.

"I remember now! Homewrecker! Right now, we're hiding like homewreckers!"

"..."

That stung at Isaac a bit. Considering the potential misunderstanding the term brought, there had to be a better way to put it.
