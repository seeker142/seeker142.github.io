<h2>[V2C2] The Stirring Performance of Gordon Smith (Age 46 Blacksmith)</h2>

Norman was a 12-year-old boy from the village of Sechen in the Lagott Territory. He had two important responsibilities. One was showing around any travelers who visit the village.

Sechen had long been known as a hot spring resort, especially in the winter when dragon attacks were less frequent. Nobles came to indulge in therapeutic baths, so entertaining such noble guests was a very important job.

On this particular day, the visitor to Sechen was undoubtedly a wealthy young lady. She appeared to be in her late teens, with vibrant orange curls and a glamorous demeanor.

She was accompanied by three individuals: a pair of women who seemed to be her attendants, and a male escort who had an exceptionally handsome face. Given his sparkling golden hair and refined countenance, the male escort stood out quite a bit.

(Whoa. He looks just like a real prince.)

The young lady with orange hair was chatting happily with her attendants, as the male escort listened with a smile.

Since there was no emblem on the carriage they descended from, they were likely traveling incognito. It wasn't uncommon for nobles to secretly visit the hot springs. For example, noble couples indulging in romances which could not be made public.

(Perhaps the young lady and her blond escort are lovers...)

Norman, who had a slightly more fanciful imagination than most, found himself daydreaming about a forbidden love between a highborn young lady and her commoner escort. As he was lost in thought, the group in question approached him for a question.

"Greetings. This village has a delightful atmosphere, doesn't it?"

The orange-haired young lady greeted Norman with a beaming smile. She exuded refinement in both clothing and demeanor, likely indicating that she was from a prestigious family.

Dealing with noble guests made Norman slightly nervous, but this wasn't his first time. To carry out his important duties, Norman put on a customer-service smile.

"Hello, honored travelers. Welcome to the hot spring village of the Silent Witch!"

<p style="text-align: center;">＊　＊　＊</p>

(W-Why is my name... mentioned alongside a hot spring...?)

Monica involuntarily grimaced.

A quick glance at Isabelle, Agatha, and Isaac revealed that they wore the smiles of unsuspecting tourists without a hint of suspicion. Their perfect smiles were, honestly, pretty unnerving.

While suppressing her trembling body, Monica reflected on the exchange that led them to Sechen Village.

<br/>

——It seems there's an impostor of the Silent Witch in Sechen Village.

From the moment they learned about this fact, Isabelle and the others acted swiftly.

Isabelle first instructed the young coachman (Apparently Agatha's twin brother named Alan) to send the other servants back to the Kerbeck Territory and arrange for a carriage without the Count's emblem.

Agatha's brother, Alan, wore an expression that seemed to say, "Again?" but efficiently carried out the given tasks. Apparently, such occurrences were routine in House Kerbeck.

Meanwhile, Isaac quietly packed for the journey until the carriage arrangements were complete. However, he pondered until the last moment whether or not to bring his rifle. What exactly did he plan to hunt?

"Um... I think it would be better if the luggage is lighter," Monica had cautiously suggested, and Isaac returned with a calm smile.

"You're right. A sword should be sufficient to subdue a small village."

Monica felt as though she heard highly unsettling words, but she pretended not to notice.

In any case, she succeeded in preventing the introduction of the rifle.

As Monica breathed a sigh of relief, Isabelle spoke with a confident tone.

"Don't worry, Onee-sama. Despite appearances, Agatha is proficient in ancient spear techniques!"

"…"

What exactly was there to be reassured about?

When Monica looked to Agatha for help, the maid picked up Monica's broom leaning against the wall and gave it a light swing. The sound it made cutting through the air was not the result of random flailing.

To the stunned Monica, Agatha cheerfully declared, "Rest assured, Monica-sama. I can handle most opponents with a mop, a clothesline pole, or any rod-like object."

Again, Monica wondered what she was supposed to find reassuring.

Seeing the trio radiating an aura that was somehow both cheerful and intimidating, Monica felt she couldn't leave them unattended, and packed her belongings into her travel bag.

<br/>

Thus, the real Silent Witch arrived at Sechen Village with her friends.

At first glance, Sechen Village seemed like an ordinary and unremarkable small village. It bore a resemblance to the village Monica often visited when she lived in the mountain hut. The only noticeable differences were the faint scent of sulfur and steam rising from various places, indicating the presence of hot springs.

They were welcomed at the entrance by a young boy, who Isabelle questioned with the face of an unsuspecting young lady.

"This is my first time visiting here, so what does the village of the Silent Witch mean?"

In response to Isabelle's question, the black-haired boy smiled and took out four cards from his pocket.

"Well, you see... Oh, everyone, please take one of these first."

The received card had six large squares, and on the frame's edge, it said:

*Collect six stamps and exchange them for a commemorative prize!*

Monica stared intently at the card, wondering what it meant. Meanwhile, the door of a nearby building opened, revealing a man.

He appeared to be in his mid-forties, and was muscular with a bald head. As indicated by the sign on the building he emerged from, it seemed he was a blacksmith. Evidence of this lay in the burns on the man's hands and arms, typical of someone engaged in blacksmithing.

However, the man was wearing a navy-blue robe. In his hand, he held a long staff.

The large blacksmith was dressed like a mage for some reason. Upon seeing Isabelle and the others, he announced in a resounding voice.

"Hello! Hello! I am one of Ridill's Seven Sages, the Silent Witch!!"

Understanding the meaning of his words took Monica quite some time.

Not only Monica but also Isabelle, Agatha, and even Isaac were left speechless, staring at the self-proclaimed Silent Witch.

The bald Silent Witch, clearing his throat, grinned confidently at Monica and the others. It was a threatening smile, as if he was about to devour them.

"Now let me demonstrate my chantless magic to our esteemed travelers right away!"

Saying this, the bald Silent Witch raised his staff high and shouted.

"Kyyyyeeeeeiiii!! Behold! My secret technique! The ultimate skill, chantless magic!!"

What on earth was "chantless" about that? Monica wondered. She probably wasn't the only one thinking that.

With veins bulging on his bald head, the man swung down his staff with a spirited cry.

"Haaaaaaaaah!!"

Simultaneously with his shout, a flame flickered at the tip of the staff.

For a moment, Monica thought there might be some mechanism in the staff, but no. That wasn't an enchanted item; it was genuine magic. Someone was likely casting magic from the shadows.

Turning towards the astonished Monica and the others, the bald Silent Witch took something out of his pocket.

"Welcome to Sechen Village. Now, miss, let's give you a stamp."

The bald Silent Witch pressed the stamp he took out onto Monica's card with a thud. The stamp read "The First Witch."

(...The First Witch?)

Monica looked up at the stern face of the bald Silent Witch and timidly asked, "Uh, what is this?"

"If you meet the six Silent Witches in this village and get their stamps, you can exchange them for commemorative prizes. Do your best to collect them all."

The bald Silent Witch laughed heartily and patted Monica on the shoulder. Then, he pressed stamps onto Isabelle and the others' cards before returning to the blacksmith.

Monica turned to Isaac, still clutching the stamp card.

"I-I didn't know there were six of me..."

"Monica, calm down. It seems like some kind of village promotion."

"Vi-village promotion...?"

As Monica blinked her eyes repeatedly, the door of a shop with a sign that said "Rooster Inn" opened, and a girl of about ten jumped out.

Adorned in a navy-blue robe resembling the bald man's, the girl held a cute staff whittled from a wooden branch.

"Hello, travelers! I'm the second Silent Witch. If you collect six stamps, you can exchange them for commemorative prizes at our store. Oh, here are the stamps!"

"..."

Monica handed over her card as instructed, and she received the second stamp.
