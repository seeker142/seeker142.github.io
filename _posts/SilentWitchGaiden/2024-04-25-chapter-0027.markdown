<h2>[V3C3] Gather at the Scene, Disperse at the Scene</h2>

Festivities continued in the castle for a week following the day of the New Year ceremony,

The Seven Sages were supposed to stay in the castle during this period, but as soon as the first day's ceremony ended, Ray jumped into a carriage and hurried to the main residence of the Albright family.

When people think of a family of shamans, they often imagine a dilapidated mansion covered in mold and moss. However, the main residence of the Albright family was located in the upscale residential area of the royal capital. It was actually quite a splendid mansion.

The history of House Albright was inferior in terms of length to House Roseberg, the family of the Thorn Witch. That said, the Second Abyss Shaman's business acumen brought them a great deal of wealth.

Above all, cursecraft was a rare skill with few practitioners. Since House Albright practically monopolized this school of magic, they had control over all curse-related matters throughout the nation.

Due to the increase of magicians in recent years, the value of being a "prestigious family of magic" was on the decline. However, the unique abilities of House Roseberg and House Albright allowed them to reserve seats in the Seven Sages for the heads of their families.

Passing through the splendid gate of the family residence, Ray passed through the garden with heavy steps.

"Ugh... I hate this... How long has it been since I last saw Grandmother..."

"Hehe, exactly seven months and four days."

Just as Ray heard a hoarse voice near his ear, he felt a warm sensation on his cheek.

Ray immediately covered his cheek and turned around, seeing a plump old lady right behind him...

"Kyaaaaa!"

Uttering a scream as high-pitched as tearing silk, Ray fell on his backside.

Standing behind Ray was a plump lady with purple hair and pink eyes. She wore a black lace dress and a hat adorned with crow feathers.

Her heavily wrinkled face was covered in a thick layer of makeup, crossing the line from garish to downright ominous.

Ray sincerely thought that he was fortunate to meet her in the early afternoon. If he encountered such a nightmarish old lady at night, his delicate heart would surely stop.

"Hehehe, what's with that scream? You sound like a maiden in distress."

"G-G-Grandmother... Ugh... my cheek got contaminated from Grandmother's kiss..."

While Ray sat on the floor, rubbing his slobbery cheek, the old lady smiled, twisting her thick lips adorned with purple rouge lipstick.

"I always love those reactions of yours. Tormenting people is the role of a shaman... Ah, your suffering just added three years to my life."

Her body, which was probably twice Ray's width, shook with genuine and joyous laughter. This old lady enjoying Ray's discomfort was none other than Ray's grandmother and the second Abyss Shaman, Adeline Albright.

Considering Adeline's plump figure and Ray's slender one, they didn't look like blood relatives at all. However, her vivid purple hair and gem-like sparkling pink eyes clearly indicated their kinship.

The shamans of House Albright engrave all the cursed formulas they've invented onto their own bodies, thus harboring numerous curses within themselves. Due to this, their hair and eyes change color to inhuman shades, and curse symbols cover their bodies like tattoos.

Among all the successive Abyss Shamans, the one harboring the most curses was the Third Abyss Shaman, Ray Albright. The number of curses he carried was an astonishing two hundred, or perhaps even more.

Simply surviving so many curses without being consumed by them was impressive. Ray was known as the most exceptional "vessel of curses" in the history of House Albright.

His talents were very different from Raul, who boasted the highest mana in the country, and the chantless magic practitioner Monica, but Ray was also considered a genius in his own right.

Nevertheless, the precision of each individual curse didn't match up to his predecessor Adeline. In a serious confrontation of curses, Adeline would likely emerge victorious.

As Ray bit his lip, Adeline lifted her sagging cheek and grinned.

"By the way, why are you here? We're in the middle of the New Year's ceremony. Shouldn't you be in the castle?"

"Y-You should know...! I-I'm here because you decided on a fiancé for me without saying anything!"

In response to Ray's outcry, Adeline put on a sarcastically surprised expression and widened her pink eyes.

"Oh my, what are you making a fuss about now? That was like, half a year ago. I've already sent formal announcements of the engagement to our acquaintances all over the country."

"W-why?! Why did you decide on it without telling me anything?!"

Adeline sighed and spoke with a distant look.

"Throughout the ages, shamans have always been hated. Even with the royal endorsement, there are plenty who look upon us with prejudiced eyes... That's why, when you were highly praised at the Supreme Council, it made me happy."

By Supreme Council, Adeline was likely referring to the incident from a year and a half ago.

Ray played a role in clearing the suspicions surrounding the second prince, Felix Arc Ridill, who was accused of being an impostor.

Regardless of the truth, the Abyss Shaman became the celebrity who lifted the curse on the second prince, and subsequently, significantly changed the people's perception of shamans.

"Thanks to your efforts, House Albright is secure. Now, we only have the issue of a successor..."

Cutting her words there, Adeline bent down and brought her face close to Ray's.

The old lady's face occupied Ray's entire field of vision.

"But you... You keep shutting yourself in without any sign of women. So, your doting old grandmother took the liberty of arranging a fiancé for her grandson."

"N-no way! You just wanted to harass me!"

After all, this old lady always boasted, "I love seeing other people's suffering more than anything," She was notorious for enjoying tormenting others.

As Ray continued to protest, Adeline chuckled and planted a grand kiss on Ray's cheek, complete with a resounding smooching sound.

"Agyaaaaaaah! Ah, my cheek... my cheek... ugh..."

Under his grandmother's intense mental assault, Ray's heart was on the verge of breaking down. This hurt him more than any curse.

Having left purple kiss marks on both cheeks, Adeline delivered the news to Ray with an evil smile.

"Oh right, about your fiancé. She's scheduled to arrive tomorrow. Kehehe... You're free to never come back to this mansion, but if you do... I wonder what fate awaits her."

Ray shuddered in the face of his grandmother's terrifying smile.

Adeline was an evil granny who thrived on the suffering of others. If Ray didn't comply, she'd likely subject Ray's fiancé to severe harassment.

Even so, Ray was terrified of meeting his fiancé.

Because if his fiancé saw his purple hair and said something like "Ew, gross" or "You're repulsive," the delicate Ray would probably never recover.

As Ray clutched his head, groaning, Adeline chuckled with delight.

"It's about time you man up, Ray."

"N-No, no! Leave me alone!!"

Crying and screaming, Ray turned his back on Adeline and fled.

As he ran frantically while flailing his limbs, he collided with someone just around the corner. It was a tall woman in travel attire.

The woman didn't scream; she merely staggered a bit. In fact, it was the less agile Ray who let out a clumsy scream as he fell.

"...Are you okay?" asked the woman who Ray bumped into, extending her hand towards him.

(...How kind. A goddess, or perhaps the incarnation of one.)

Normally, Ray would say something like, "Surely this is fate. Do you love me?" but the current Ray just wanted to flee from his grandmother as quickly as possible.

So, he immediately got up and bowed without even looking at the woman's face.

"...I-I'm sorry...!"

Saying just that, Ray hastily dashed away from the scene.

The stunned woman simply stared at Ray's retreating figure, then quickly composed herself and walked toward the gate of the Albright mansion.

On the other side of the gate stood a woman with a striking appearance. She was undoubtedly the effective ruler of this mansion, Adeline Albright.

Placing her travel bag at her feet, the woman bowed to the old lady.

"Good day. It's a pleasure to meet you. I've come from Valmbelk, and my name is Frieda Blanquet."

"Oh my, you arrived quite a bit earlier than I expected."

"Yes, I'm skilled at riding horses."

In response to Frieda's words, the old lady blinked her pink eyes.

Frieda tilted her head in confusion and wondered if she had said something strange.

"...You didn't use a carriage?"

"Right. I didn't have much luggage, so I rode my own horse. I've left it at the inn for now, so can you show me the stable for this residence?"

"I'll have a servant guide you later. But first..."

Adeline straightened her posture, raised her sagging chin, and looked down at Frieda with sharp eyes.

"Frieda Blanquet. If you plan on marrying into my household, you'll have to abide by my rules."

Without flinching under the forceful gaze, Frieda stared right back into Adeline's eyes.

What exactly were the rules of the prestigious Albright family of shamans?

As Frieda waited for Adeline's next words, the old lady tilted her thick neck and continued.

"I've always wanted to say that line, but now that I think about it, we don't really have any rules."

"..."

"No special rules or anything. Go ahead and do whatever you want."

What a turn of events. Her important engagement meeting ended as soon as she arrived!

After a moment of silence, Frieda asked the old lady, "So I'm really free to do as I please?"

"I won't say it twice."

"Understood."

Freedom of movement was extremely convenient. Frieda Blanquet accepted her new circumstances easily.

The women of Valmbelk had always been adaptable, and strong in the face of adversity.
