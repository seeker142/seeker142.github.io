<h2>[Characters]</h2>

**Frieda Blanquet (20)**

Younger sister of Margrave Valmbelk. Specializes in cleaning, bookkeeping, swordsmanship, and horse riding.

In just one day, she accomplished the triple play of the princess carry, kabedon, and kissing on the back of the hand——an impressive feat.

<br/>

**Henrik Blanquet (26)**

Margrave Valmbelk. Despite his slender appearance, he is one of the top swordsmen in the Empire.

<br/>

**Ray Albright (23)**

One of the Seven Sages, the Abyss Shaman.

Enjoys writing poems.

<br/>

**Monica Everett (19)**

One of the Seven Sages, the Silent Witch.

While she understands advanced mathematics, matters of the heart remain elusive. Thinks this incident allowed her to level up her skills as a villainess. Probably not though.

<br/>

**Raul Roseberg (21)**

One of the Seven Sages, the Thorn Witch.

Knows how to nurture vegetables but is clueless about nurturing love.

"Sis got super angry at me for borrowing a dress without permission!"

<br/>

**Louis Miller (29)**

One of the Seven Sages, the Barrier Mage.

Initially rejected being called an old man, but when his wife asked, "So you'll reject me when I'm old too?" he quickly changed his tune, saying, "I would be so happy to grow old with you."

<br/>

**Bradford Firestone (47)**

One of the Seven Sages, the Artillery Mage.

A middle-aged man prone to romantic encounters during dragon subjugations. Generally vulgar, yet also popular.

Used to be a troublemaker, but once Louis joined the Seven Sages and became his rival, his passion for combat intensified.

<br/>

**Mary Harvey (Age Unknown)**

One of the Seven Sages, the Starseer Witch.

Won't compromise on making beautiful young boys wear shorts.

"If Ray were about fifteen years younger, I would have prepared shorts for him~"

<br/>

**Gideon Rutherford (74)**

The Smoke Mage. Professor at the Minerva. Monica's teacher and Louis's master.

Messy eyebrows and a smoking pipe are his trademarks.

<br/>

**Curtis Ashley (23)**

Cyril and Claudia's cousin. If Cyril hadn't been adopted, there was a chance he could have become the Marquis.

"Man, I'm glad we adopted Cyril! Becoming the Marquis would have been too much for me! I just want to live a carefree life! Hahahaha!"

He may be rather casual, but he's admired by his younger brother.

<br/>

**Adeline Albright (75)**

Ray's grandmother. Second Abyss Shaman.

An eerie granny who extends her lifespan by teasing others. Weighs the same as ten wooden crates packed tightly with apples.

<br/>

**Mick Henning (29)**

Servant in the Albright household.

Doesn't want to do more work than his salary demands and prefers to finish work on time. Likes working in the Albright household because it's a white-collar workplace with no overtime.

<br/>

**Glenn Dudley (19)**

Recently passed the Novice Mage exam.

Failed the written exam twice in a row, but passed successfully after getting help from Isaac. "The president is a great teacher! Amazing!"

<br/>

**Isaac Walker (22)**

Suggested an alliance with Valmbelk to Bridget, to which she responded, "Oh my, Your Highness, you are quite enthusiastic about work."

<br/>

**Cyril Ashley (20)**

Witnessed Frieda's heroic princess carry with Monica, then looked down at his own slender arms. Feels down.
