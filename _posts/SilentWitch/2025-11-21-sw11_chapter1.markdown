<h2>Chapter One: A Lecture Invitation</h2>

*Machine translated from the first 60 pages of the Bookwalker preview.*

---

From a shared carriage connecting the royal capital and the western provinces, a certain man stepped down at the Sazandol stop.

He appeared to be in his early twenties. His unruly brown hair was tied back, with a single lock of bangs springing forward.

He wore a mage's robe, but tasteful accessories such as a patterned scarf were casually worked in, giving him a stylish air. In his hands he held a bag and the staff of an intermediate mage, making his profession obvious at a glance.

The man looked up at the sky, raised a hand to shield his eyes from the dazzling sunlight, and murmured meaningfully.

"Hmph… so I've finally made it this far."

Though he said "finally," it wasn't as though he had overcome some great trial or endured any particular hardship.

This mutter was simply a bit of staging, meant to let him savor the feeling of "Me, entrusted with an important mission by my master, having completed a long journey—how cool!"

He glanced around, spotted a suitably scenic roadside tree, crossed his arms, and leaned against it.

He could have sat on a bench to rest, but after riding in the carriage for so long, his backside hurt.

Leaning in the shade with his eyes closed, putting on the act of a relaxed, cool version of himself, he reflected on the purpose that had brought him here.

Naturally, even the flashback had to be cool.

(...My name is Hugo Galletti, and I am the disciple of a certain mage. Today, by the command of my great master, I have come to this town to meet one of the Sages living here…)

The Sage who resided in this Sazandol—the Silent Witch, Monica Everett—was a prodigious genius who joined the Seven Sages at the youngest age in history.

The only practitioner of chantless magic in the world, she was a national hero who had defeated the Black Dragon of Worgan and the Curse Dragon of Reinberg, and proven the innocence of the cursed Second Prince.

(…Well, if we're talking about greatness, my master isn't inferior either! After all, he's the strongest man in the Kingdom of Ridill!)

Snorting proudly through his nose, Hugo took a moment to savor the air of the port town.

Compared to the royal capital, Sazandol was considerably warmer, but the wind that blew was still a little cold. It seemed that winter would come earlier than usual this year.

Hugo hailed from the maritime nation of Alpatra, located southwest　from the Kingdom of Ridill. Alpatra was mild throughout the year, so Ridill's autumn felt a bit chilly to him.

(Come to think of it, in the Kingdom of Ridill, winter is said to be brought by the Ice Spirit King, right?)

There was also a legend that Shelgria, a winter spirit and retainer of the Ice Spirit King, used fallen leaves as letters to announce the coming of winter to the people.

If that was the case, Shelgria must be quite busy this year. It was the height of autumn—more precisely, the fourth week of Orve, the middle month of autumn—but it seemed likely that winter's cold would arrive in less than a month.

Looking around, Hugo spotted a hot wine stall.

He was on an errand, but surely a single cup of hot wine would be fine. To men of Alpatra, wine was practically the same as grape juice.

(The hot wine in the capital doesn't use much citrus. I really want one with slices of lemon or orange in it.)

As he thought this and reached into his bag for his wallet, a slip of paper tucked beside it fell to the ground. It was the note with the Silent Witch's address—the place he was headed.

"Ah, crap…!"

He hurried to pick it up, but at the worst possible moment, an autumn gust snatched the note away.

"Gyaaaah! W-w-w-wait, wait, waaaait—!"

Hugo's expression drained of color as he chased after the note.

The paper finally came to rest beyond a crowd of people, on a wide, paved road. Hugo dashed out onto the road and grabbed the fallen note.

At that moment, a horse's neigh rang out right beside him.

Hugo looked up and realized—a splendid carriage was bearing down on him.

The young driver screamed.

"Watch out!"

There was no time for a spell. Clutching the note, Hugo leapt back and tumbled spectacularly, smashing his head against the ground.

Though startled by the mage-like youth who had suddenly darted out, the young driver managed the reins skillfully and narrowly avoided a direct collision.

"Ah… ah…"

The youth who had run out in front of the carriage lay on his back, completely motionless. As the driver trembled with tear-filled eyes, the carriage door opened and a black-haired man stepped out.

<br/>

The driver—Rick Hollis—scrunched up his face and clung to the black-haired man.

"Bartholomeus-san… I-I just ran someone over… Wah… waaah…!"

"Uh, no, he just fell and hit his head. You did well, Rick."

Anyone could see that the one at fault was the mage who dashed out so suddenly. Without Rick's driving skill, he might have been kicked by the horse and had his head split open.

As Bartholomeus soothed Rick, a young lady leaned out from inside the carriage.

"Bartholomeus-san, is that person all right?"

"Ah, miss. Please don't leave the carriage. There are bandits who try to trick people by jumping out in front of carriages, you know. Let me check him myself."

Saying that, Bartholomeus examined the condition of the young man lying on the ground.

It seemed the youth wasn't acting—he was genuinely unconscious.

While checking his pulse just in case, Bartholomeus noticed that the young man was gripping a note in his hand.

"Huh? This address is…"

Bartholomeus' eyes widened as he read the address on the note, and he called out toward the carriage.

"Miss, can you take a look at this?"

<p style="text-align: center;">＊　＊　＊</p>

"Monica—! Please help me study for the exam!"


It was one autumn afternoon when Glenn Dudley, the always-energetic butcher's son, visited Monica's house with some sausages as a gift. Monica happened to be explaining magical formulas to her uninvited disciple, Isaac, at the time.

"Exam study… ah, the mage exam?"

"That's right! Um, the novice mage certification exam!"

At Glenn's loud voice, Nero, who had been napping by the window, let out an annoyed "nyaa" and flicked his tail.

As Isaac slid the papers he had spread out to the side, he looked at Glenn with surprise.

"I thought you already had the novice mage certification, Dudley-kun. With your abilities, it shouldn't be that difficult, right?"

"Hehe, you think so…?"

At Isaac's praise, Glenn wore a complicated expression—clearly happy, yet unable to rejoice wholeheartedly.

"Well, I've actually taken it twice already… and failed the written test both times. My master and everyone in the Magic Corps have been really busy, so it's kind of hard to ask them to help me study."

About two months earlier, the Neigal Prison Explosion Incident had resulted in multiple escapees.

Thanks to the efforts of the Magic Corps and the knights, most of them had been captured, but two were still at large.

"Um… what happened with the Wind Hand Mage…?"

Monica asked Glenn timidly.

"He still hasn't been caught. That's why my master and the folks in the Magic Corps are all on edge."

One of the escaped convicts, the Wind Hand Mage Adolf Faron, was a mage who had been a fellow candidate for the Seven Sages when Monica and Louis participated in the selection.

He had been a classmate of Louis during their Minerva days, and it seemed there was bad blood between them.

At the time of the Seven Sages selection, Adolf had attempted to murder Louis's fiancée and was ultimately arrested. As a result, Monica and Louis joined the Seven Sages.

In truth, during the magical combat portion of the selection, Monica was the one who defeated Adolf Faron.

(So that's why Louis-san keeps telling me to be careful about my surroundings, but…)

More than Monica, who concealed her place of residence, the ones truly in danger were Louis and his family.

Louis was concerned about this as well and had arranged for his wife and child to be protected by the Magic Corps.

"Since most of the escapees have been caught one way or another, my master's apparently been going around repairing and reinforcing barriers all over the country…"

The greatest mystery of the Neigal Prison Explosion Incident was who had destroyed the prison's barrier, and how.

The barrier surrounding Neigal Prison was among the strongest in the country, resistant to attacks from both inside and out. To break it would require firepower on the level of the Artillery Mage, one of the Seven Sages like Monica.

As a result, it seemed that for the time being, they would be reviewing the barriers protecting important facilities throughout the country.

"And then my master told me I'd better pass the novice mage exam by the time he gets back from his next job… while swinging his staff around…"

Monica let out a small "eep."

To Louis, a staff was neither a tool for controlling magic nor an ornament to display authority. It was a blunt weapon for beating down people he disliked.

Monica didn't want to see her friend get hit, and if possible, she wanted to help Glenn.

She wanted to—but this time, there was a reason she couldn't.

"I'm sorry, Glenn-san. I can't help you study for the exam."

"Huh?"

It seemed Glenn hadn't expected to be turned down. He stared, mouth hanging open.

Fidgeting with her fingers, Monica mumbled an explanation.

"I supervise the written portion of the mage exam… so I know the exam questions…"

As Monica shrank back apologetically, Isaac spoke smoothly with an elegant smile, without even pausing for breath.

"When you hear 'the Silent Witch,' chantless magic is what comes to mind, but that's not her only achievement. Even before becoming one of the Seven Sages, while she was still studying at Minerva, Monica developed twenty-two new magical formulas. Including improvements to existing formulas, that's even more. In other words, about thirty percent of the spells in basic magical theory textbooks have been influenced by her work. That alone is said to be an accomplishment worthy of becoming one of the Seven Sages—and on top of that, my master can use chantless magic too, so she's really amaz—"

"Um, Ike, Ike… that's enough…"

Unable to bear it any longer, Monica stopped Isaac, while Glenn stared at her intently.

"Monica, you're… really amazing… But yeah, I guess that means I can't have you teach me…"

Glenn slumped forward onto the table. His usually lively, springy hair seemed unusually limp and wilted today.

Isaac tapped Glenn's shoulder lightly.

"If you don't mind, I could teach you."

"Huh? You, President?"

It wasn't only Glenn who was surprised. Monica was too.

To Monica and Glenn, both staring wide-eyed, Isaac said with a gentle smile,

"I've tried solving some of the past mage exam questions before. I think I can manage teaching material at the novice mage exam level."

Because he concealed his background and his affinity, Isaac was in a position where he could never take the mage exam himself. Even so, he had studied for it on his own.

Monica was once again impressed by her disciple's diligence.

<p style="text-align: center;">＊　＊　＊</p>

"Ugh… 'Between temporary mana imbuement and permanent imbuement in magical potions, which is more strictly regulated?'… I vaguely remember reading this in the textbook… ughhh…"

"Right. As the name suggests, the effects of temporary imbuement are temporary. Permanent imbuement lets you make potions whose effects last a long time."

"Then the stricter one is permanent imbuement? But… temporary imbuement kind of feels like it could be, too…"

Glenn spun his quill pen aimlessly, muttering under his breath.

That was when Isaac offered him a hint.

"It helps to imagine actually using it. The easier something is to do, the stricter the regulations tend to be."

"I'm not really cut out for imbuement magic to begin with… ah, but temporary imbuement is definitely easier, right? Making an effect stick is supposed to be really hard, whether it's imbuement magic or barrier magic."

It is far more difficult to stabilize a magical effect into a potion compared to simply soaking with mana. And this isn't limited to magical potions.

Take barrier magic, for example. Between temporary seals and a seal lasting a long period of time, the latter is overwhelmingly more difficult.

"…Which means the one with stricter regulations is temporary imbuement!"

"Correct."

The two of them continued solving problems one after another.

Whenever Glenn stumbled, Isaac would break down the wording and explain it to him.

Glenn had been complaining that difficult phrasing made him not even want to read in the first place, but at Isaac's explanations he nodded along with an "uh-huh," clearly convinced.

"The difference between quasi-forbidden magic and forbidden magic is certain to appear on the exam, so let's be sure to memorize it. Researching quasi-forbidden magic is allowed, but its use is restricted to specific conditions. And there are exceptions for the Seven Sages."

"So my master and Monica are special cases!"

"Exactly."

Even though he was only stating something utterly ordinary and unremarkable, Isaac smiled as if to say "well done" and continued his explanation.

As she went on with her own work while listening to the explanations beside her, Monica found herself quietly impressed. Isaac wasn't just good at explaining—he was good at capturing Glenn's interest, too, softening technical terms by comparing them to familiar things and using a slightly more casual way of speaking.

Because of that, even Glenn, whose concentration tended to waver quickly, was able to listen all the way through.

"Ike, you're really good at teaching."

When Monica blurted that out, Isaac's eyes widened slightly. It was a surprised reaction, as though he hadn't expected to hear that.

"…I wanted to become someone who could teach."

He didn't say to whom.

Sensing a faint, nostalgic tinge in his words, Monica chose not to ask further and closed her mouth.

After finishing his explanations, Isaac began to write briskly on the back of some used paper. It seemed he was making some simple practice questions.

"All right, let's review what we've covered so far. You'll just be answering true or false, so don't feel pressured. When you're done, we'll take a break and eat some meat pies."

"Meat pies!"

With renewed enthusiasm, Glenn threw himself into the practice problems.

Isaac quietly stood up and headed for the kitchen.

Monica stopped her work and followed after him.

"Um, Ike… is there anything I can help with?"

"It's fine. I'm just reheating the meat pies."

Indeed, there was nothing wasteful about the way Isaac went about reheating them. There was probably nothing Monica, who wasn't used to this sort of task, could help with.

Inside the oven, the meat pies had intricately braided crusts on top, with leaf-shaped cutouts of pastry arranged all around the rim of the pie dish.

Monica could accurately draw shapes she had memorized, but she couldn't imagine herself being able to replicate such elaborate pastry decorations. To begin with, she had never even thought about making pie crust herself.

(Ike is really handy…)

As she watched Isaac's profile while he checked the heat, Monica vaguely wondered what kind of life he had lived until now.

She knew that the man who had continued to play the role of the Second Prince had originally been that prince's attendant. But she knew nothing about his life before that.

What kind of life he'd lived before becoming an attendant, how he'd come to serve in that role, whether he had family… those weren't things she felt she should ask out of mere curiosity. Monica herself wouldn't go out of her way to talk about her own past.

As she gazed blankly into the oven's orange-lit interior, Nero came into the kitchen. In his mouth was the bundle of sausages Glenn had brought.

Dragging the package along the floor, Nero looked up at Isaac.

"Let's eat this now. I like it when the outside's nice and crispy."

"Dudley-kun's reward meat pie comes first."

Saying that, Isaac took the bundle from Nero's mouth and put it away in a cupboard that couldn't be opened by a cat's paws.

Nero slapped the floor with his tail in irritation, then looked up at Isaac with narrowed eyes.

"…I've been thinking about this for a while now. Aren't you a bit too soft on Loudmouth?"

At Nero's comment, Isaac blinked lightly.

It was the reaction of someone being told something they hadn't been aware of themselves.

"Am I? …Maybe so."

Isaac smiled with eyes that seemed to recall something fondly.

"He's cute, like a troublesome little brother, right?"

At those words, Monica was just a little surprised.

She hadn't expected to hear words that evoked family coming from his mouth.

Isaac peered curiously at Monica's face as she stood there with her mouth half open.

"…Monica?"

"Ah, no, it's nothing!"

Waving her hands flusteredly, Monica cast her gaze around the kitchen.

Watching Isaac prepare the meat pies for Glenn made Monica want to do something as well. But since she knew the exam questions, she couldn't help with studying.

In that case, she thought.

There was a delicious dessert Lana had taught her about the other day—a slightly bitter cake scented with coffee, which was wonderful when eaten with fluffy, sweet cream.

What if she bought that and served it to the two of them after they finished studying?

(I haven't told Ike about that shop yet… yeah!)

Since preparing tea and sweets for guests is the disciple's job, Isaac usually takes the initiative. But today, she would be the one to do it.

Preparing treats for a friend and a disciple who were working hard at studying—once she decided that, she started to feel oddly excited.

"Um, I'm going to step out for a bit!"

"Is that so? Be careful."

"Yes!"

Nodding energetically to her worry-prone disciple, Monica stepped outside clutching her wallet.

Once outside, she glanced at the garden for just a moment. This had become a recent habit.

Until not long ago, she had had no interest in the garden and had gotten by with only the bare minimum of weeding, but lately Isaac had been taking care of it.

The shrubs that had been planted from the beginning were neatly trimmed to an even height, and flowers now bloomed in the flowerbed that had long been left unattended. Apparently, he had received some seedlings from the elderly woman next door.

Isaac was very handy. Not only with cleaning and cooking, but with gardening as well.

When Monica had honestly praised him for that, he had smiled vaguely and said, "I was taught a long time ago."

She recalled the splendid garden at Duke Crockford's estate, where they had infiltrated before. A vast garden meant to display authority, utterly incomparable to the one at Monica's home. He had helped take care of that garden, too.

Monica turned her eyes to the flowers in the bed.

The small pink flowers resembling lilies were nerines; the white flowers with many rounded petals layered together were a kind of anemone; and the red flower spikes—what were those called again? She'd ask him next time.

Among the shrubs were elderflowers and blueberries. Isaac had said that next early summer, they'd soak the elderflowers in syrup to make cordial, and turn the blueberries into jam.

(…This is my home's garden.)

She hadn't cared about the garden before, but she could tell that Isaac was tending it for her. Cleaning, cooking, gardening—it was all the same.

So she resolved to remember those things properly.

—*Thank you for cleaning. It really helped.*

—*Thank you for cooking. The meals are very delicious.*

—*Thank you for the garden work. The flowers are beautiful; I'm happy.*

So that she could say thank you to him like that.

Savoring the small happiness she had right now, Monica stepped outside the garden—and then suddenly noticed something.

Someone was running toward her. It was her friend, Lana Colette.

Lana was wearing her work dress, but Bartholomeus and Rick weren't with her. Had they gone to tie up the carriage?

"Lana, what's wrong?"

Out of breath, Lana glanced at Monica's outfit—she wasn't in her robe right now, but in casual clothes—and asked in a low voice.

"Sorry to spring this on you. Were you just heading out?"

"Um, Glenn-san came over, and Ike is helping him study, so I was thinking of going to buy some cake…"

At Monica's clumsy explanation, Lana's face stiffened as she glanced nervously over her shoulder.

"Walker-san is here, then? It might be better if he hid for a bit."

"Huh?"

Just then, a man's voice called out, "Wait, wait up—!"

Lana frowned.

"Oh, honestly! I told you to wait just a moment…!"

Running toward them was a young man in his early twenties. He wore a mage's robe, and in his hand he held the staff of an intermediate mage.

His unruly brown hair was tied back, with a single lock of bangs sticking out and bouncing about.

When the man reached Lana, he spoke to her cheerfully with an affable smile.

"Seriously, thanks so much! Not only did you take care of me, you even showed me the way. I'm super grateful—really, you're a total goddess!"

He was oddly familiar with Lana. On top of that, Lana looked fidgety.

(Could this be…!)

Apparently, there was such a thing as picking people up in the world.

Lana was stylish and cute, so it wouldn't be strange for her to get hit on. That must be it.

Monica was always being helped by Lana. So this time, it was her turn to help Lana.

Gathering up all the courage she had, she stepped forward.

"E-excuse me!"

Monica raised her voice with all her might and scrunched her face up tight.

She opened her eyes as wide as they would go, lifted her eyebrows as far as possible, and pulled her lips straight to the side. This wasn't an imitation of a frog. It was the scariest face Monica could manage.

"W-what do you w-want with my f-friend!"

She focused too much on making a scary face, and her words came out garbled.

Even she could tell how awful this was. Still, she should be maintaining a scary expression.

Grrr-ing with effort, Monica glared up at the man.

Then Lana whispered to her with a troubled look.

"Um, actually, this person's business isn't with me…"

At that moment, the man seemed to realize something and looked back and forth between Monica and Monica's house.

"If you're from this house… ah, wait, could it be—you're the Silent Witch's disciple? I'm Hugo Galletti. I'm the disciple of the Artillery Mage, Bradford Firestone-sama."

"Huh?"

"Since we're fellow disciples of Seven Sages, let's get along!"

With a friendly, beaming smile, Hugo grabbed Monica's hand and shook it.

*IMAGE*

"I'm here today on an errand for my master. Is your master free right now?"

"Ah, um… well…"

She had mistaken a fellow disciple who had come on an errand for a pick-up artist, and had even threatened him with a scary face.

The tension drained from Monica's features, and in a voice full of apology, she said.

"I'm the Silent Witch… I'm sorry…"

"Huh?"

Hugo's reaction was exactly the same as Monica's had been a few seconds earlier.

<p style="text-align: center;">＊　＊　＊</p>

Seated facing each other on the sofa, Monica and Hugo both wore awkward expressions.

"Silent Witch-sama, I sincerely apologize. Please forgive my rudeness…"

"Um, no, I'm the one who acted rudely. I'm very sorry…"

Hugo had thought Monica was a disciple; Monica had thought Hugo was trying to hit on Lana. They were equally at fault.

Between the two of them sat Glenn, who broke the awkward atmosphere with his usual carefree tone.

"So Hugo-san, you're the Artillery Mage-san's disciple? That's awesome."

"Well, Glenn-kun, you're the Barrier Mage's disciple, right? Did you come on an errand for the Barrier Mage?"

With a wry smile, Hugo asked, and Glenn answered breezily.

"I came to have Monica teach me. For the novice mage exam."

"Huh? What? Studying for the novice mage exam with a Seven Sage other than your own master…?"

"I'm friends with Monica!"

"…Glenn-kun, aren't you kind of a big deal?"

Monica thought quietly to herself.

(I can't exactly say that just a little while ago, Glenn-san was being taught by Ike…)

Isaac Walker's public identity was that of the Second Prince, Felix Arc Ridill.

Incidentally, Glenn had been friends with the Third Prince, Albert, since their days at Serendia Academy, and even now they occasionally held study sessions together.

A butcher's son who was the disciple of the Barrier Mage, a friend of the Silent Witch, and who received tutoring from the Second and Third Princes. Glenn Dudley-kun truly was a big shot.

Of course, there was no way she could tell Hugo any of that. Monica fidgeted as she interjected.

"Um, Galletti-san, how did you end up with Lana…?"

"Well… there was a bit of an unfortunate accident…"

According to Hugo, while he was searching for Monica's house, he had the misfortune of nearly colliding with Lana's carriage.

After falling and hitting his head, he had been clutching the note with Monica's address written on it. Noticing this, Lana had listened to his story and then brought him to Monica's house.

At the time, Lana must have realized that Hugo was the Artillery Mage's disciple and considered the possibility that he knew the faces of the royal family.

So before Hugo arrived at Monica's house, she hurried to warn Monica that if Isaac was staying there, it would be better for him to hide. She was too competent for her own good.

(Lana, thank you so much…)

After that, Monica had excused herself to Hugo by saying, "I need to tidy up a bit…" and explained the situation to Isaac, asking him to hide. By now, he was probably quietly preparing dinner in the kitchen.

"Well then, this is the letter I was entrusted with by my master—the Artillery Mage, Bradford Firestone."

As he said this, Hugo held out a rather large envelope. It seemed to contain materials for an academic conference.

As Monica took out the stack of documents, wondering if he wanted her to review them, a card labeled "Invitation" fluttered down onto her lap. It was an invitation to a lecture held mid-Shelgria, the first month of winter.

"My master will be attending a lecture in the middle of the month after next. He was hoping you might attend as well, as the one to explain the spell formulas."

Listening to Hugo, Monica looked at the invitation.

The venue was Cressburn Magical University.

When one thought of a prestigious institution for training mages, Monica's alma mater, Minerva, came to mind first. Minerva was a high-level educational institution in both practical application and research.

Cressburn Magical University, on the other hand, focused primarily on magical technology and the study of magical history. Many graduates of Minerva's advanced course chose to enroll at Cressburn instead of remaining as research students.

In fact, Monica had ties to Cressburn Magical University. It was located within the domain of Marquis Highown.

At present, Monica was conducting joint research with the Thorn Witch, Raul Roseberg, on the imbuement of magic into plants, funded by Marquis Highown, Cyril's adoptive father. Part of the fields used for this research lay within the Highown domain, and when inspecting harvests and soil, they borrowed equipment and reference materials from Cressburn Magical University.

Monica turned the invitation over. Written on it in a lively hand she recognized were the words, "Let's go together! —Raul."

Because of her joint research with Raul, Monica frequently traveled to the Highown domain. It seemed the Artillery Mage was suggesting that she attend the lecture while she was there anyway. Judging by the added note on the invitation, Raul was enthusiastic about the idea.

(A lecture… in the domain of Cyril-sama's father…)

Monica disliked speaking in front of people, and in the past she had avoided lectures and research presentations whenever she could. But since presenting the Black Holy Grail at the Supreme Council, she had taken the podium at academic conferences several times to properly inform others about the magical device.

This time, she wouldn't be the main presenter, but rather take a supporting role, such as explaining spell formulas. In that case, she could accept.

Above all, if one of the Seven Sages attended, it would lend prestige to the lecture itself. Monica had been indebted to Marquis Highown in many ways through their joint research, and she wanted to repay him even a little.

Clenching her fist on her lap, Monica let out a soft breath through her nose and replied.

"I'll accept."

At Monica's answer, Hugo felt a wave of relief. He was reassured that he could bring a favorable response back to his master.

After they confirmed the details and the discussion reached a conclusion, Glenn let out a small "Hmm."

He crossed his arms, lost in thought.

"Cressburn Magical University… I feel like I've heard that name somewhere…"

"It's a school in the domain of Cyril-sama's father. The library and archives are well stocked, with lots of books of high historical value."

"Oh, right! Isn't that the facility where my master's planning to redo the barrier?"

Ah—Monica parted her lips slightly.

In the aftermath of the Neigal Prison Explosion Incident, Glenn's master, the Barrier Mage Louis Miller, had been reviewing the barriers installed at important facilities.

Cressburn Magical University was among those facilities.

Hugo must have heard about the barrier review as well, because he nodded along to Glenn's words. With the movement of his head, a lock of hair sticking out from his bangs bounced about.

"Yeah, yeah. Apparently they're reinforcing the barrier there because of that grimoire of black flames… '*The Blackest Demise*.'"

For an instant, Monica's heart skipped a beat, because the words "black flames" made her think of Nero.

Black flames—the infernal fire of the underworld that can incinerate all in existence.

In the modern age, only the flames breathed by black dragons had been confirmed, but in the past, black flames had existed as a form of magic wielded by humans. The grimoire for casting such black flames was "*The Blackest Demise*."

Flicking his bangs smartly with a finger, Hugo spoke to Glenn in a slightly patronizing tone.

"You know, Glenn-kun? That's not a spellbook, it's a grimoire. If someone with enough mana touches it, there's a chance it could activate."

"Oh right, I just studied that! Spellbooks are textbooks for explaining how to use magic, and grimoires are a kind of magical tool that activates when you read them aloud!"

It seemed Isaac's instruction was steadily bearing fruit.

At Glenn's words, Hugo nodded along with a smug, senior air.

"Well, realistically speaking, black flames require an absurd amount of mana, so activation is basically impossible."

(The Blackest Demise…)

Although research into black flames was forbidden in the modern era, as long as the black dragons that wielded them existed, it was possible that research might one day become necessary as a countermeasure.

For that reason, "*The Blackest Demise*" was not deemed as a forbidden book, instead remaining under strict seal to this day.

If black dragons were to start appearing frequently, perhaps humans would bring out "*The Blackest Demise*" as a countermeasure.

Monica found herself gazing absently toward the windowsill where Nero usually napped.

<p style="text-align: center;">＊　＊　＊</p>

The door to the room where the guests were was left just slightly ajar, so that from the hallway one could hear the conversation. After confirming the exchange between Monica and the guests, Isaac, with Nero in his black cat form perched on his shoulder, moved to the kitchen.

Of course, he muffled his footsteps, and even when closing the door, he made sure not to make a sound.

"Nero, did you hear?"

"Huh? Something about Monica going somewhere?"

At Nero's rough summary, Isaac replied in a voice that barely concealed his excitement.

"The Silent Witch explaining spell formulas! Do you realize how incredible that is? An explanation by a great Seven Sage who is the most well-versed in magical formulas in this country is not something you can just attend every day. Any mage would want to hear it… Ah, I want to go. If possible, I want to listen from the front row…"

"But you have Monica explaining stuff to you all the time."

"Hearing it at a lecture has a different kind of appeal."

"Whatever. I'm not going anywhere in winter. Sazandol's way warmer. More importantly, where's my meat pie?"

Ignoring Nero's demands, Isaac reviewed his own schedule.

The length of Isaac's stay in Sazandol that Monica had permitted was two weeks.

However, moving around while concealing his identity took time, and there were occasions when unavoidable duties as a lord arose. As a result, his actual stay usually amounted to about a week.

Still, since he had recently recruited Brendan Ottod as his steward, it had become much easier to leave things in his absence. Even now, Brendan was keeping an eye on the Erin domain together with Isaac's contracted spirit, Wildianu.

(If I wrap up this visit a little early, I should have quite a bit of leeway from mid–Shelgria through the New Year.)

Naturally, if the other Sages were attending, then he needed to be especially careful with his disguise.

This time he had left Wildianu in the domain to assist the steward, but if he were to secretly attend the lecture, it would be reassuring to have Wildianu's illusions.

(…And besides, mid–Shelgria is at the perfect time.)

Now then, he needed to pen a letter to some fellow comrades who loved the great Silent Witch.

"Hey, where's my meat pie!"

At Isaac's feet, the black cat meowed noisily. Fending him off, Isaac took the nicely warmed meat pie out of the oven.

What wafted up to tickle his nose was the appetizing aroma of the filling and spices wrapped in the pastry.

The decorative lattice of the pie crust had been brushed with beaten egg before baking, giving it a beautiful golden color.

—Suddenly, he remembered.

Isaac's mother had been skilled at making pies, cleverly using scraps of meat, vegetables, and bruised fruit to turn them into something delicious.

Those pies were also elaborate in appearance: the surface woven into lattice patterns or braids, and dough shaped like flowers or leaves adorning the rim of the pie dish, making them a delight to behold as well as to eat.

Young Isaac had once helped decorate that pie crust.

What came back to him was the memory of his mother's greatly swollen belly. Thinking about the younger brother or sister who would soon be born, he had clumsily decorated the pie with his small hands.

—*Someday, big brother will make you a delicious pie!*

He had said that, speaking to his mother's belly.

"…"

Gazing down at the freshly baked pie, he drifted into thought.

Since when had he stopped remembering?

(…I know. It was after Arc died.)

For Felix Arc Ridill, the memories of the boy who grew up in Lugaroa were unnecessary. That was why he did his best not to remember.

(Now I can remember again.)

Thinking that, Isaac cut the meat pie into pieces with a crisp motion.

One of the Seven Sages, the fifth Thorn Witch, Raul Roseberg, was heading toward the Roseberg family's detached house, humming to himself with a bucket of gardening tools hanging from his arm.

There was a reason he was so visibly buoyant.

It had been decided that he would stay for several days in the Marquis Highown's domain during Shelgria.
