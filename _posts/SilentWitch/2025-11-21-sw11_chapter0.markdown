The Barrier Mage, Louis Miller, one of the Seven Sages, was walking through the headquarters of the Magic Corps.

As the former commander of the Magic Corps, this building had once been his workplace. Even if the halls were a bit convoluted, he had no trouble finding his way.

Before long, he arrived at one of the break rooms equipped with a simple kitchenette. There, he found the person he was looking for seated in a chair, drinking coffee.

It was a young man with dull blond hair dressed in a Magic Corps uniform—Owen Wright, Captain of the First Division. Back in their student days, he had been Louis's roommate, and they still kept in touch.

They weren't the type to adhere to formalities, so Louis skipped the greetings and got straight to the point.

"Looks like my foolish disciple isn't here today."

Louis's disciple, Glenn Dudley, worked as a general helper for the Magic Corps, and during breaks he would come here to study under Owen.

But today, Glenn was nowhere to be seen. Only Owen sat in the break room, quietly sipping his coffee.

"Glenn said he was going to study with a friend. He flew off using flight magic."

"I see."

Louis was glad to see that Glenn had a study companion. Most likely a friend he'd made back at Serendia Academy.

Louis took a random glass from the cupboard and sat down across from Owen.

Owen took a sip of his coffee and gave Louis a flat, unimpressed look.

"...Shouldn't the master be the one teaching their disciple?"

"For some reason, Glenn never comes to me for lessons. Strange, isn't it?"

"Maybe put a hand on your chest and reflect on your teaching style?"

Owen acted uninterested, but he clearly cared a lot about Glenn.

Because of that, Glenn adored and respected Owen like an older brother. Louis often wished the boy would show at least some of that respect to his own master.

Louis pulled a bottle of liquor and a jar of jam from his robe pocket and poured both into his glass in equal measure. This was the fuel that powered Louis Miller.

"I'll be away from the capital for a while."

"I heard you're getting flooded with requests to reevaluate barrier formations."

"Indeed. We really need to settle on the new Sage candidates soon... Owen, how about becoming one yourself? I can write you a recommendation."

"I'm busy trying to become commander of the Magic Corps."

Louis liked that response.

As Louis took a satisfied sip from his glass, Owen asked a question.

"Can't you just recommend the disciples of the current Sages?"

"At present, none of our disciples are qualified to become Sages themselves."

Of the current Seven Sages, only the Barrier Mage, the Artillery Mage, and the Starseer Witch had disciples.

The Thorn Witch and the Abyss Shaman had disciples from House Roseberg and House Albright respectively, but none personally learned from the current heads.

Louis's own disciple Glenn was still an apprentice, so he was out of the question. The Artillery Mage's disciple was only an intermediate mage. The Starseer Witch's disciple was an advanced mage, but lacked the accomplishments needed to be named a Sage.

As Louis explained all this, Owen's expression shifted as if he'd remembered something.

"Come to think of it... does the Silent Witch not have a disciple?"

"She's still just a little girl, after all."

Louis thought it might be interesting if the Silent Witch took a disciple.

But he couldn't imagine that monstrous genius teaching anyone.

She herself didn't seem fully aware of it, but the Silent Witch was a rationalist and perfectionist to an extreme degree—arguably the most finicky and troublesome type of all. On top of that, her ability to manage basic daily life as a human being was practically broken.

Anyone sane who tried learning under Monica would surely give up within a week.

As Louis was thinking this, Owen muttered quietly.

"I heard a rumor that the disciple of a former Sage, the Thunder Mage, climbed into the upper ranks of dragon-slaying records. With solo kills even."

"Oh?"

Among Louis's generation, many named the Artillery Mage, Bradford Firestone, as the mage they respected most. Owen, sitting here now, was one of those who had become a mage out of admiration for the Artillery Mage.

And the hero of the generation before theirs was Graham Sanders, the former Sage known as the Thunder Mage.

He was the unrivaled number one in Ridill for solo dragon kills, and he had distinguished himself in the war over fifty years ago. For that reason, he was said to have more statues erected in his honor than any other mage in the country.

With a figure that famous, one would expect news about his disciple to surface somewhere, but Louis had heard next to nothing about the Thunder Mage's disciple until now.

"I'll look into it when I have time. For now, I need to finish the task in front of me."

The most pressing matter at hand was the capture of the escaped convicts from Neigal Prison.

In the autumn, one of the Seven Sages, the Silent Witch Monica Everett, captured Darrel Hollis, an escaped prisoner who tried to flee the country.

Around the same time, the Artillery Mage Bradford Firestone apprehended three escaped convicts who committed robbery.

Furthermore, Louis's senior disciple, the Starspear Witch Carla Maxwell reached out to the Society of Mana in Geography for information, allowing the escaped convicts to be caught one after another.

Only two remained at large. One of them was a man with ties to Louis himself.

The Wind Hand Mage, Adolf Faron. A former classmate of Louis's from their Minerva days, and for Owen, a senior in the same research lab.

Adolf had been a talented mage who, like Louis, had once been considered a candidate for the Seven Sages.

But he had done the unthinkable: he used Owen to try to drag Louis down, injuring Louis's wife—Rosalie, who at the time had still been his fiancée. To make matters worse, he attempted to pin the blame for the crime on Owen.

It was a bitter memory for both Louis—who had nearly lost the woman he loved most—and Owen, who had been manipulated and used as a tool, causing him to partially abet Adolf's scheme.

Because of that incident, Adolf had been imprisoned in Neigal Prison, but after the explosion at Neigal near the end of summer, it was discovered that he had escaped.

Thus, Louis evacuated his family to the Magic Corps headquarters—in other words, to this building.

"I'm counting on you to look after my family while I'm gone."

That man would surely target Louis's family. But as one of the Seven Sages, Louis had responsibilities. He could not move freely.

That was why he entrusted the task to someone he trusted—Owen.

Having grown up in the harsh northern region, Louis rarely relied on or trusted others. If he was going to trust someone, it would only be someone he could think, "If they betray me, I was a fool for trusting them," and accept it.

Louis looked straight at Owen with that conviction.

His eyes contained the solid trust of spending their student years together and fighting side by side in the Magic Corps.

"I'm counting on you, Owen."

"Yeah."

Owen set his empty cup back on the table and met Louis's gaze.

"I'm grateful for the chance to redeem myself, Louis."

A single wagon was stopped a short distance off the main road in the eastern region of Ridill.

Its cargo was mostly books. This wagon traveled around various regions of Ridill, helping transport reading materials. Just recently, it had delivered new publications from the capital to Kerbeck in the east.

Now, while letting the horse rest for a bit, the coachman and the guard were leisurely enjoying lunch.

The slightly overweight middle-aged man sitting in the driver's seat was the coachman. The guard was dressed like a mage, sitting inside the wagon beside the cargo crates. Each was nibbling at a walnut bun.

"Man, the Silent Witch sure is popular these days."

So said the coachman, recalling the piles of Silent Witch–related books he had delivered to Kerbeck.

Ever since her role in the Supreme Council proving the Second Prince's innocence, the Silent Witch had become one of the most popular of the Seven Sages.

Kerbeck in particular viewed her as a hero, since she had saved them during the Black Dragon incident in Worgan.

Responding to the driver's small talk, the guard muttered quietly:

"...If we're talking about the Seven Sages, I prefer the Artillery Mage. He was my hero when I was a kid."

"Ah, Artillery Mage–sama! Yes, I understand completely. One-shot one-kill is just so cool, isn't it?"

Bradford Firestone, one of the Seven Sages and known as the Artillery Mage, was about the same age as the coachman, so the coachman had often heard of his exploits.

The powerful hero who appeared during a slump in Ridill's mage community. His six-fold reinforcement magic was said to be powerful enough to blow apart even a dragon's torso.

Children would brandish sticks and play "Boom! Boom!" pretending to be the Artillery Mage.

The guard swallowed his walnut bun and murmured with distant eyes:

"There was a time when I wished... that someday, I could be a Sage like him."

The guard was a mage, perhaps around thirty years old. Many people of that age group admired the Artillery Mage when they were children.

He wore a mage's robe, and in his hand was an intermediate mage's staff. Both looked fairly new, likely meaning he had only recently passed the intermediate mage exam.

He looked a little gaunt and worn down, but from his speech and mannerisms, one could sense a refined upbringing.

(The son of a fallen noble, who only recently managed to pass the intermediate exam... something like that, maybe.)

Or perhaps he came from a prestigious house, but chased his dream of becoming a mage out of admiration for the Seven Sages, rejected his family's support, and had since drifted in hardship... also plausible.

At the very least, he didn't look like someone with the luxury of choosing his work. That was probably why he had accepted a job guarding a small, weak merchant company like this one.

Feeling vaguely apologetic, the coachman gave a sheepish smile.

"Sorry we can't pay you more. The recent rise of the Anderson Company has really pushed small merchants like us to the edge..."

"Anderson Company? ...Ah, I've heard they've grown even bigger these past two or three years."

"Yeah. You know those refrigerated wagons? The ones that can keep cargo chilled during transport? Anderson Company holds the patent on those."

"Using magical knowledge for commerce... what tasteless behavior."

There was clear contempt in the guard's voice. As expected, he was likely from a noble family.

Magic had originally been a technology monopolized by the noble class. Perhaps because of that, nobles tended to scorn the commercial use of magic.

It was the Anderson Company that had pushed past the pressure of such nobles and risen to prominence.

The Anderson Company was also famous for investing huge sums in road maintenance throughout Ridill. Because of that, nobles and other merchant groups who depended on land routes for travel and trade couldn't afford to oppose them. They were truly one of the kingdom's foremost businesses.

(A tiny merchant company like ours can't even be compared to them... it's ridiculous to try...)

Sighing with envy in his heart, the coachman began diligently picking the walnuts out of his bun. He had bought it only because the other breads were sold out, but he actually hated walnuts.

He placed the removed nuts onto the handkerchief spread across his lap. He would give them to the birds or animals later.

The guard silently watched this from inside the wagon.

To someone well-bred, the act of picking apart bread must have looked terribly ill-mannered.

"Oh, how embarrassing. When I hate something, I just can't help noticing it..."

"Yes, I understand completely."

The mage stared fixedly at the discarded walnut pieces. His eyes were shadowed.

"The more you hate something, the more it stands out... no matter how hard you try to remove it."

The guard leaned back against the cargo crates and closed his eyes.

He was a mage, yes, but not an official member of the Mage Association. His true identity was that of an escaped convict.

Having fled Neigal Prison, he traveled alternately by flight magic and on foot until he infiltrated the Mage Association headquarters, stole a mage's robe, a staff, and some money. After that, he continued living on the run, posing as a traveling mage.

He still remembered it clearly—the moment of the explosion in the prison.

The explosion happened early in the morning. The other prisoners rushed outside as fast as possible, but he didn't escape immediately. Instead, he hid behind the rubble and observed.

He wanted to know what had caused the explosion. If it wasn't an accident but someone's doing, then depending on who it was, that person might be an ally.

And that was when he encountered *her*.

<p style="text-align: center;">＊　＊　＊</p>

"You have good eyes."

At some point, without him noticing, she was simply there—as if she had appeared from nowhere, without a sound.

A girl in her early teens with extremely pale blond hair. She wore a pure, graceful white dress wholly out of place in a prison.

However, contrary to her delicate appearance, a sneer of contempt for others played on her face. There was even a sharp sense of rejection, as if to say she did not care for familiarity.

The girl crouched down and peered at his face.

It was an innocent, childlike gesture. And yet, it felt as if someone had maliciously rummaged through his mind—an unpleasantness that made him nauseous.

"'*I don't care what happens to this world,*' and '*I hope everything gets ruined*'... those are the thoughts I see in your eyes."

The roar of flames, the sound of the prison collapsing, the shouts and screams of guards and prisoners.

In a world filled with the sounds of slaughter, the girl's voice cut through with eerie clarity.

"Hey, human."

With that sweet whisper, her pretty face curled into a mocking smile as she taunted him.

"Do you want your wish granted? I can make it come true."

"Shut up..."

The words burst out of him before he could think—perhaps provoked by the girl's malice.

He had no clue who this girl was, but he didn't want anyone meddling.

He was selfish. He would not hand over the fury and hatred burning inside him to anyone else.

"I'd never be satisfied to see someone else twist his face in despair! I need to do it myself! Me! Me alone!"

He raved, spitting and shouting. The girl narrowed her eyes and chuckled softly.

Her laugh resembled that of a child, but it contained no innocence. The entity wearing the form of a girl was mocking him.

"Right. I rather like you. I cannot form a contract, but I'll give you something good."

A white light twinkled in the girl's hands, and ice particles gathered. They coalesced into the shape of a bell—a handbell with a handle.

She spoke no incantation so she was not human—a spirit, and a greater one at that.

"This bell will temporarily amplify your magic. It can be used only five times, so think hard before you use it."

She pressed the icy bell into his hands, then, as if bored, turned and walked away.

Beyond the billowing smoke she headed into, the silhouette of a tall man stood—her companion, it seemed.

"Ah, Throth. Sorry to keep you waiting. I found a human I liked a little, so I gave him a present... Oh, have you finished your business over there? Then let's go."

She glanced back once.

Her eyes were full of hatred, laughing at the world.

"By all means, go make a mess. Wreak havoc with your warped wish!"

With those words the rubble collapsed, and the girl vanished beyond the debris and flames.

The man clutched the bell she had given him and fled the prison, thinking to himself.

Early dawn, just before the explosion, he had heard the ringing chime of a bell. Immediately after came a thunderous blast, and the barrier covering Neigal Prison was destroyed.

(That must have been this bell...)

It was the work of that girl. He couldn't explain the mechanism, but she had used the bell to destroy the prison.

This prison was for mages, so the barrier protecting it was the strongest in the nation. And the power to break it was now in his hands.

(With this, I can do it...!)

<p style="text-align: center;">＊　＊　＊</p>

After finishing his walnut bun, the man disguised as a guard gently pressed the leather pouch at his waist.

Even through the thick leather he could feel a faint chill. The bell was inside.

(It has five uses, and I used one as an experiment. Four remaining. I need to be careful about the rest...)

"Sorry to keep you. Shall we be going?"

The coachman tossed some walnut fragments to a bird as he approached.

The fugitive mage realized something and asked the coachman.

"Are you from the north, by any chance?"

"Oh? Did you notice my accent? Yes, that's right. I grew up in the north."

"Ah, I thought so."

The fugitive mage, Adolf Faron, pasted on a fake smile as he clicked his tongue inwardly.

(I hate northern accents.)

The things you hate always catch your eye. No matter how much you try to exclude them, they keep slipping into your view.

That man always looked down on him as if he didn't even exist.

All the more reason to erase him completely this time. With the power of this bell.

(I'll do it again... and this time...)
